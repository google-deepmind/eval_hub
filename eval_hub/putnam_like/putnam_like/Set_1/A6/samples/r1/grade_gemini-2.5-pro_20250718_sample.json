    "comment": "The student incorrectly concludes that the function must be identically zero. The correct answer is no, which can be shown by constructing a counterexample as outlined in the rubric. The student's solution attempts to use an advanced argument based on Fourier transforms, but the reasoning is flawed and misapplied to the space of general continuous functions, leading to the wrong conclusion. The provided 'continuity argument' is also vague and not a valid proof. As the solution does not follow any of the steps in the rubric and arrives at the incorrect answer, no points can be awarded.",
