    "comment": "The solution incorrectly concludes that the statement is true, providing two flawed arguments. The primary proof by contradiction fails by incorrectly assuming that if the integrand is positive on a small subset of the integration domain, the entire integral must be positive. This ignores the possibility of cancellation from negative values elsewhere in the domain. The alternative Fourier analysis argument is also fallacious; it wrongly deduces from F(g)*F(f)=0 that F(f) must be zero, ignoring that the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of a ball has zeros. The solution completely misses the correct approach of constructing a counterexample.",
