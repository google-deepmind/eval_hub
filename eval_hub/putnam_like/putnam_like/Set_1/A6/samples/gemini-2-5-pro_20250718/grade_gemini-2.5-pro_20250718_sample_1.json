    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof that the statement is false. The solution correctly reformulates the problem in terms of a convolution, applies the Convolution Theorem, and constructs a valid counter-example using Bessel functions. Although the method is different from the one suggested in the rubric, it is entirely correct, elegant, and demonstrates a deep understanding of Fourier analysis. The reasoning is flawless from start to finish.",
