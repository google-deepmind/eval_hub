    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method, which uses Fourier analysis and Bessel functions, differs significantly from the one outlined in the rubric, it is mathematically sound, elegant, and arguably more powerful. The student correctly rephrases the condition as a convolution being zero, correctly computes the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of a disk, and uses the properties of Bessel functions to construct a valid counterexample. The reasoning is flawless and all calculations are accurate.",
