    "comment": "The model correctly finds the Fourier transform of the convolution and uses the zeroes of the J1 function. However it uses this theory completely wrong, as it claims that outside of these zeros the Fourier transform is zero. Moreover, it fails to specify the precise function/distribution spaces involved and to justify that f indeed has an ordinary, continuous Fourier transform; without these clarifications, the argument remains incomplete.",
