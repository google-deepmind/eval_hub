    "comment": "The student concludes that the statement is true, whereas the correct answer is that it is false. The provided solution in the rubric shows how to construct a valid counterexample. The student's proof attempt, while demonstrating knowledge of Fourier analysis, contains a critical flaw. It incorrectly assumes that the Fourier transform of a continuous function is continuous. This is only guaranteed if the function is also integrable (in L^1), a condition not given in the problem. Because the student's entire argument rests on this false premise and reaches the wrong conclusion, no points can be awarded according to the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Error: The student attempts to prove the opposite of the correct statement. Conceptual Error: The argument relies on an incorrect property of the Fourier transform (continuity of f does not imply continuity of its Fourier transform)."
