    "comment": "The student begins with a valid and insightful substitution that correctly transforms the integral. The final step, identifying the limit of the partial sums of the series for 'e', is also correct. However, the solution contains a major logical leap by stating that the integral is equal to the sum without any justification. This step, which involves binomial expansion, interchanging summation and integration, and evaluating the resulting integrals (equivalent to the Gamma function), is the most substantial part of the problem and is worth 5 points in the rubric. As no work is shown for this critical evaluation, no points can be awarded for it. The student is awarded points for the correct setup (3/3) and the correct final limit calculation (2/2), but not for the skipped integration part (0/5).",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major omission of proof/justification. The core of the problem, which is the evaluation of the integral via binomial expansion and term-by-term integration, was stated as a result without any supporting work or explanation."
