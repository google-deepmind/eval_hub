    "comment": "The solution is elegant and mathematically sound, arriving at the correct final answer. While the method employed (change of variables and use of the incomplete Gamma function) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (binomial expansion and integration by parts), it is a valid and sophisticated alternative. The derivation is clear and correct at every step, demonstrating a complete understanding of the problem. Full credit is awarded.",
