    "comment": "The final answer is correct, and the alternative method used (change of variables and properties of the Gamma function) is a valid approach to solving the problem. However, the grading rubric is highly specific, awarding points for a solution path that involves binomial expansion, term-by-term integration, and evaluation of a specific sum. As the submitted solution does not follow any of the prescribed steps in the rubric, no points can be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological Deviation: The solution did not follow the required method outlined in the grading rubric. Additionally, the argument using an approximation (`~`) lacks rigorous justification."
