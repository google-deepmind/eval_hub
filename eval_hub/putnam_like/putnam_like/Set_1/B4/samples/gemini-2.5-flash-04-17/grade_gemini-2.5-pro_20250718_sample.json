    "comment": "The student provided a complete and correct solution. Although the method used (substitution and properties of the Gamma function) is different from the one outlined in the grading rubric (binomial expansion), it is entirely valid and rigorously executed. The student successfully transformed the integral, correctly analyzed the resulting terms, and used the Squeeze Theorem to arrive at the final, correct answer. Full credit is awarded for a flawless alternative solution.",
