    "comment": "The student provided a complete and correct solution. Although the method used (substitution and the Gamma function) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (binomial expansion), the reasoning is sound, rigorous, and achieves the correct result. The student's approach successfully transforms the integral, performs the main analysis by bounding a remainder term, and correctly computes the final limit. All steps are logically sound and well-executed, meriting full credit.",
