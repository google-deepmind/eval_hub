    "comment": "The student provides a mathematically sound and elegant solution, arriving at the correct final answer. However, the method used (substitution, properties of the Gamma function, and the Squeeze Theorem) is completely different from the one outlined in the grading rubric. The rubric awards points for specific steps involving a binomial expansion and a recursive integration-by-parts argument. Since none of the prescribed steps were followed, no points can be awarded according to the given rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation; the solution does not follow the specific method required by the grading rubric."
