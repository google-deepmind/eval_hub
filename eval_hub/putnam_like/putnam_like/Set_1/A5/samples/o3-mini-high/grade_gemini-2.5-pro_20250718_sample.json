    "comment": "The student arrives at the correct final answer, and the calculation of the sum of the arguments is correct. However, the entire solution relies on the small-angle approximation `sin(x) ~ x`. Using this approximation inside a sum over `n` terms, i.e., `lim sum sin(theta_k) = lim sum theta_k`, is a non-trivial step that requires rigorous justification (for example, using Taylor's theorem with a remainder term to bound the error). This justification is missing, making the argument non-rigorous. The solution does not use the methods outlined in the rubric (Jensen's inequality, trigonometric identities for bounding), which test deeper concepts. Credit is awarded for the correct calculation and final result, but significant points are deducted for the lack of rigor in the key step.",
