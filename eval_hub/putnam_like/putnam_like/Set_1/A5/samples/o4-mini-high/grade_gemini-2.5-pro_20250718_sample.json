    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and arguably more elegant. The student correctly identifies the sum as a series of sines with arguments in an arithmetic progression, applies the corresponding standard summation formula to find an exact closed form, and then correctly evaluates the limit. All steps are clearly explained and mathematically sound.",
