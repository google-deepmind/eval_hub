    "comment": "The student correctly calculates the sum of the arguments of the sine functions and its limit, which is the correct final answer \u03c0. This work partially aligns with the rubric's first step and the calculations needed for the second step, earning 2 points. However, the solution relies on the small-angle approximation (sin(x) \u2248 x), which is not a rigorous proof. The rubric requires a formal argument using inequalities (like Jensen's) to establish bounds for the Squeeze Theorem. Since this rigorous justification, worth the bulk of the points, is absent, the score is low.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of Rigor: The argument relies on an approximation (sin(x) \u2248 x) without formal justification of the error term, which is not a valid proof method in this context."
