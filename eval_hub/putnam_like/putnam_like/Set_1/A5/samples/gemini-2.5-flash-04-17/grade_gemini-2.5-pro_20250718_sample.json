Although the method (Taylor series approximation) differs from the one in the rubric (Jensen's inequality and trigonometric identities), it is a standard and perfectly valid approach for this type of problem. The argument is well-structured, the calculations are correct, and the error terms are properly analyzed and shown to vanish in the limit.",
