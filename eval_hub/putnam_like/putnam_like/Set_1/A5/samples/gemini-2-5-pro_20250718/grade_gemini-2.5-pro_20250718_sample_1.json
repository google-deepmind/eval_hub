    "comment": "The student provides two distinct and complete solutions, both of which are mathematically sound and rigorously justified. The first method, using a Taylor approximation with a careful error analysis, is flawlessly executed. The second method, which uses the formula for the sum of sines in an arithmetic progression, is also correct and demonstrates a good command of relevant formulas and limit techniques. The final answer is correct, and the reasoning is clear and well-structured. The work is exemplary and deserves full marks.",
