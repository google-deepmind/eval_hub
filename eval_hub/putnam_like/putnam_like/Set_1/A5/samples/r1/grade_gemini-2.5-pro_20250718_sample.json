    "comment": "The student arrives at the correct final answer, but the method used is not rigorous and differs significantly from the approach outlined in the rubric. The core of the student's argument relies on the approximation sin(x) \u2248 x, but the justification for this is flawed, including a major error in approximating the argument of the sine function in Step 1. While the student correctly calculates the sum of the arguments (a key component of the official solution), they fail to provide a valid proof structure (like the squeeze theorem required by the rubric) to justify why this sum's limit equals the original problem's limit. Points are awarded for the correct calculation of the main term's limit, but significant deductions are made for the lack of rigor and conceptual errors.",
