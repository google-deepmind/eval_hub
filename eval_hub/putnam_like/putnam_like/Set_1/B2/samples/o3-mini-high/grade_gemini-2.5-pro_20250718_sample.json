    "comment": "The provided solution does not follow the method specified in the rubric. Furthermore, the alternative proof by contradiction is invalid. It contains a critical logical error in Step 5, where a lower bound for a sum is incorrectly deduced by combining a lower bound for one term with an upper bound for another. This invalidates the entire proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The proof contains a logical fallacy. The solution method also deviates entirely from the one specified in the grading rubric."
