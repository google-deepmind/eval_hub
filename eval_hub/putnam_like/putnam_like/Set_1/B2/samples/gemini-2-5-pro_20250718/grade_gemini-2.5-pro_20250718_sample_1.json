    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof that is mathematically sound. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric (by finding an explicit solution for u^2(x) instead of working with inequalities on its derivative), the alternative approach is valid and demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying differential equations. The final conclusion is correctly derived. Full marks are awarded for a correct, alternative solution.",
