    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. The method used is an alternative to the one in the rubric, relying on a proof by contradiction. The student defines a function h(x) = 2x - u(x)^2 and demonstrates that the assumption h(x) \u2264 0 for some x > 0 leads to a contradiction. The key step, which involves using the uniqueness of solutions for the original second-order ODE to rule out the possibility that u(x)u'(x) = 1, is highly sophisticated and rigorously executed. Although the approach is significantly more complex than the intended solution, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a deep understanding of the material. Full marks are awarded for a correct and complete alternative solution.",
