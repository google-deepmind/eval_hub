    "comment": "The solution is excellent and fully correct. The student correctly identifies and solves the differential equation for the auxiliary function g(x) = u(x)u'(x). This approach is slightly different from the one in the rubric, which relies on uniqueness theory to bound the function, but it is equally valid and rigorous. The subsequent integration and use of inequalities are flawless.",
