    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies the auxiliary function $q(x) = u(x)u'(x)$ and derives its governing differential equation $q' = 1 - q^2$ with initial condition $q(0)=0$. Instead of using an abstract uniqueness argument to bound $q(x)$, the student correctly solves the ODE to find $q(x) = \tanh(x)$. This explicit solution is then used effectively with a monotonicity argument (on the function $g(x)=u(x)^2-2x$) to prove the final inequality. The method is different from the one outlined in the rubric but is equally valid and rigorous.",
