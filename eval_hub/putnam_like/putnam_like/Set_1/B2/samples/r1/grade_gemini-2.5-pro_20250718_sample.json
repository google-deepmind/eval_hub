    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and provides a full proof for the statement. The method used is different from the one outlined in the rubric but is equally valid. The student successfully recasts the problem in terms of E(x) = u(x)^2, solves the resulting differential equation to find the explicit form of u(x)^2, and then uses a known inequality to establish the final result. The reasoning is clear and the calculations are flawless.",
