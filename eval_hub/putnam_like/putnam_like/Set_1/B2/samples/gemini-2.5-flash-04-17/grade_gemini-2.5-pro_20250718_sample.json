    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and rigorous proof. Although the method differs significantly from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and sophisticated alternative approach. The student defines an appropriate auxiliary function and uses a proof by contradiction, skillfully combining arguments from calculus (properties of local extrema) with the uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations. The reasoning is flawless and demonstrates a deep understanding of the concepts, meriting full credit.",
