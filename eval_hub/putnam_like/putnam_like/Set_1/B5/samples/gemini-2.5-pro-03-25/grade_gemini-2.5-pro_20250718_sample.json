    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. While the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and elegant alternative approach. The key steps, such as rewriting the sum as an integral and then proving the non-positivity of the integrand, are logically sound and well-executed. The combinatorial regrouping of the sum inside the integral is particularly insightful. Full credit is awarded for a flawless solution.",
