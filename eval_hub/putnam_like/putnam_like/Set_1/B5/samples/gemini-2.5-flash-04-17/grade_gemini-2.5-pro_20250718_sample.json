    "comment": "The solution does not follow the method outlined in the grading rubric, which involves expressing the terms as integrals over N-dimensional balls and using a product identity. Therefore, it does not earn points for the specific steps listed in the rubric. The student attempts an alternative method by regrouping the sum, but this alternative proof is not successful. The derivation of the key integral representation contains errors, and the student then proceeds by assuming an incorrect formula without proof, which is a fatal logical flaw in the argument.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary error is a major logical gap, as the core of the argument rests on an unsubstantiated and incorrect integral formula. The solution also fails to follow the method prescribed by the grading rubric."
