    "comment": "The student presents a high-level outline of a proof strategy that is entirely different from the one in the rubric. The proposed steps, such as reordering the r_i and using a 1D integral representation, are not developed into a coherent mathematical argument. Crucially, the solution fails to make the connection between the given fraction and an integral over an N-dimensional ball, which is the first step required by the rubric. The subsequent steps are vague, unsubstantiated, and do not follow the logic of the provided solution path. No points can be awarded as none of the key ideas from the rubric are present.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution is an outline of a completely different and unsubstantiated approach. It fails to provide any of the key steps or insights required by the grading rubric. The argument presented is incomplete and lacks mathematical justification."
