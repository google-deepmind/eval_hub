    "comment": "The solution presents an elegant argument based on partitioning the sum and using a one-dimensional integral representation. The technical steps of this argument, such as expanding the product and evaluating the resulting integral, are correct. However, the entire proof is built on the fundamentally incorrect premise that if $i$ is the smallest index in a set of indices $S$, then $m_S = \\min_{j \\in S} r_j$ is equal to $r_i$. This is not true in general, as the minimum value of the $r_j$ does not depend on the minimum index. This misinterpretation bypasses the core difficulty of the problem, which is handling the interaction of the various $r_j$ values within the min function. Since this invalidates the entire logical structure of the proof for the given problem, the score is low despite the demonstrated technical skill.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual Error: The solution is based on a fundamental misinterpretation of the definition of the term $m_{i_1, \\ldots, i_k}$, which invalidates the subsequent argument."
