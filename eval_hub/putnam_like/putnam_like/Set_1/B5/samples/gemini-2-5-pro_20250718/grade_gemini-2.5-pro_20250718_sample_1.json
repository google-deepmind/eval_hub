    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the provided rubric, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a strong command of the relevant mathematical techniques. The argument is well-structured, starting with a clever reorganization of the sum, followed by a valid integral representation and a correct application of combinatorial identities to show that the sum is a sum of negative terms. The conclusion follows logically. Full credit is awarded for a flawless alternative solution.",
