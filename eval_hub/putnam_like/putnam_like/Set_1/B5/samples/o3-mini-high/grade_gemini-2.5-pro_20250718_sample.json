    "comment": "The student provides an elegant solution that captures the main combinatorial idea of the problem. The argument, starting from the integral representation, is logical and correct: interchanging the summation and integral, using the product identity for the resulting geometric-like series, and correctly analyzing the sign of the integrand. However, the foundational first step, which expresses the term from the problem statement as an integral, is incorrect. The integral of $t^p$ is not proportional to a term with exponent $p-1$. This error means the solution, while internally flawless, does not solve the stated problem. The score reflects full credit for the main body of the argument (which aligns with the 8-point part of the rubric) but no credit for the incorrect setup (the 2-point part).",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Foundational error. The integral representation of the term in the sum is stated incorrectly, which invalidates the connection between the proof and the problem statement."
