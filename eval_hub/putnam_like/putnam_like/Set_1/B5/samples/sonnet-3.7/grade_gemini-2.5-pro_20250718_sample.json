    "comment": "The student provides an original and creative solution using a Laplace transform. The subsequent analysis of the factored sub-sums is correct and well-executed. However, the entire proof rests on a combinatorial reorganization of the sum which is only valid if all `r_i` are distinct. Since this is not guaranteed by the problem statement, the proof is invalid in the general case due to this fundamental logical error. Significant partial credit is awarded for the valid components and the creative approach.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Flaw: The proof's central step, a combinatorial regrouping of the sum, is only correct under the unstated assumption that the `r_i` values are all distinct. This makes the argument invalid for the general case."
