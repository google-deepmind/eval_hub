    "comment": "The student correctly identified all three solutions ($x=0, 1, -1$) by first testing simple values for $y=x^2$. However, the provided solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric, which is based on the Mean Value Theorem. The student's alternative attempt to prove the uniqueness of the solutions contains significant logical flaws. The argument using convexity is based on an incorrectly stated principle and is applied inconsistently. The argument for the case $y > 1$ is not rigorous and contains a logical leap. Therefore, credit is only awarded for finding the solutions, but not for the proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary issue is that the solution does not follow the required method outlined in the rubric. The alternative proof provided has two major errors: 1. Incorrect application of a mathematical theorem (the definition of convexity is misstated and used inconsistently). 2. Flawed proof / Logical gap (the reasoning that the function remains negative for $y>1$ is not sufficiently justified)."
