    "comment": "The student has provided a completely correct and rigorous solution. Although the method employed (analysis of a function using first and second derivatives) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (which uses the Mean Value Theorem), it is equally valid and demonstrates a strong understanding of calculus. The student successfully identifies all solutions ($x=0, 1, -1$) and provides a flawless proof that no other real solutions exist. Full credit is awarded for a complete and correct alternative solution.",
