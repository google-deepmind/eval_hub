    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method used (analysis of the function's derivative) is different from the one outlined in the grading rubric (which uses the Mean Value Theorem), it is equally valid and rigorous. The student correctly identifies all solutions for t=x^2 and provides a solid argument for their uniqueness by analyzing the function's monotonicity. The final answer is correct. The solution is flawless.",
