    "comment": "The student correctly identifies all three solutions (x = -1, 0, 1) by substituting y = x^2 and testing the integer values y=0 and y=1. However, the core of the problem is to prove that these are the *only* solutions. The student's argument for this uniqueness is based on an intuitive claim about the growth rates of exponential functions rather than a rigorous mathematical proof. The solution completely misses the intended path using the Mean Value Theorem, which constitutes the bulk of the points in the rubric. Points were awarded for finding the solution x=0 and for the final summary of all correct solutions.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Proof / Lack of Rigor. The argument for the uniqueness of the solutions is a non-rigorous, intuitive claim, not a formal proof."
