    "comment": "The student correctly identified all three solutions (x=0, 1, -1) by substituting t=x^2 and testing integer values. Points were awarded for finding the x=0 solution and for correctly stating the final set of all solutions. However, the solution completely lacks the rigorous proof required to show that these are the *only* solutions. The provided justification for the behavior of the function f(t) for t>1 and 0<t<1 is an informal assertion rather than a mathematical proof, for which the bulk of the points (7 points) are awarded in the rubric. The solution does not use the Mean Value Theorem approach outlined in the grading scheme, nor does it provide a valid alternative proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of rigorous proof / Invalid justification. The student asserts the behavior of a function without using calculus or other formal methods to prove that no other roots exist."
