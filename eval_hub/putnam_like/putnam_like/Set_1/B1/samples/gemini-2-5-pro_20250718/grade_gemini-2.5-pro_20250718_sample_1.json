    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. Although the method used (analysis of the function's derivative and Rolle's Theorem) is different from the Mean Value Theorem approach suggested by the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and well-executed alternative. The student correctly finds all solutions ($x=0, 1, -1$) and provides a sound mathematical argument to prove that no other solutions exist. The solution is flawless.",
