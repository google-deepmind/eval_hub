    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and well-reasoned. The student uses a valid and clever alternative method, simplifying the sum with the Hockey-stick identity instead of changing the order of summation. The rest of the solution correctly uses binomial identities to evaluate the resulting sum, paralleling the key ideas of the provided rubric. The final answer is correct.",
