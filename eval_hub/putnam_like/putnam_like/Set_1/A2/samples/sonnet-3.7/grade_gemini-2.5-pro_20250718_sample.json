    "comment": "The student provided a completely correct and elegant alternative solution. Instead of swapping the order of summation as suggested by the rubric, the student directly evaluated the inner sum using the hockey-stick identity. The resulting single summation was then correctly evaluated using the binomial identity for odd-indexed terms. All steps are clear, mathematically sound, and lead to the correct final answer.",
