    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric (the student evaluates the inner sum over \u2113 first, rather than switching the order of summation), it is a perfectly valid and elegant alternative approach. The use of the hockey-stick identity and the binomial theorem is flawless and leads to the correct final answer. Full marks are awarded for a correct and well-reasoned alternative solution.",
