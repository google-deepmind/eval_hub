This step is worth 1 point.
Observe that $4 \in \mathcal{D}$ and $3,5 \not\in \mathcal{D}$. Hence all elements of at least $2$-element sequence of consecutive integers in $\mathcal{D}$ are greater than $4$.

This step is worth 8 points.
Let $\ell$ denote the maximal length of a sequence of consecutive integers in $\mathcal{D}$. Suppose that $\ell \geq 4$ and that $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ is a sequence of consecutive integers in $\mathcal{D}$. Obviously $4$ divides $a_i$ for some $i \in \{1,2,3,4\}$. Since $a_i > 4 = 2 \cdot 2$ we obtain that $a_i \not\in \mathcal{D}$ -- a contradiction. Hence $\ell \leq 3$.

This step is worth 1 point.
To show that $\ell = 3$ it is enough to consider the sequence $(85, 86, 87)$ and see that $85= 5 \cdot 17 \in \mathcal{D}$, $86 = 2 \cdot 43 \in \mathcal{D}$ and $87 = 3 \cdot 29 \in \mathcal{D}$.
