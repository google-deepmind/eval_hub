    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies the problem, provides a valid example of a sequence of length 3 (33, 34, 35), and presents a rigorous proof by contradiction that no sequence of length 4 can exist. The argument that one of any four consecutive integers must be a multiple of 4, and that this number must be 4 itself if it is in D, is clear and correct. The subsequent case analysis to show this leads to a contradiction is a valid and complete method of proof.",
