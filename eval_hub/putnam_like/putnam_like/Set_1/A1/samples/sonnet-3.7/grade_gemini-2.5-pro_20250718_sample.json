    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the maximal length as 3. The solution is well-structured, providing a valid example to establish the lower bound (length \u2265 3) and a complete proof for the upper bound (length \u2264 3). The core argument, based on the fact that any sequence of four consecutive integers must contain a multiple of 4 that cannot be in the set D, is sound and clearly explained.",
