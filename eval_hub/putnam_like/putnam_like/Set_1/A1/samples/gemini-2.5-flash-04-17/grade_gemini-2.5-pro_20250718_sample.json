    "comment": "The solution correctly proves that the maximal length is 3. The argument that the length cannot be 4 or more is logically sound, demonstrating a full understanding of the core constraint (the properties of multiples of 4). A valid example of a sequence of length 3 is also provided and verified. The solution lost one point for not making the initial observation that any valid sequence of length 2 or more must contain numbers greater than 4, which would have streamlined the main proof, but the alternative path taken was also correct.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a simplifying argument. The proof that no sequence of length 4 exists was done by case analysis rather than a more general contradiction based on the size of the numbers."
