    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly proves that the maximal length cannot be 4 by demonstrating that any four consecutive integers contain a multiple of 4, and the only multiple of 4 in the set D is 4 itself, which cannot be part of a longer sequence. The student also provides valid examples to show that a length of 3 is achievable. The reasoning is complete and clearly articulated.",
