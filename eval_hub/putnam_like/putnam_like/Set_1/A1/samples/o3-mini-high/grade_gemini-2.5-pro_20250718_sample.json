    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly identifies that in any four consecutive integers, one must be divisible by 4. The key insight that the only number in D divisible by 4 is 4 itself is clearly explained and used to prove that a sequence of length 4 or more is impossible. The solution is completed by providing a valid example of a sequence of length 3, namely (33, 34, 35). The reasoning is flawless and well-articulated.",
