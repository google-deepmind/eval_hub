    "comment": "The solution is entirely correct and well-written. The student successfully demonstrates that no sequence of four consecutive integers can be in the set by correctly arguing that the only such integer divisible by 4 is 4 itself, and then showing that the sequences containing 4 do not work. A valid example of a sequence of length 3 is provided to show that the bound of 3 is achieved. The reasoning is clear and complete.",
