    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the maximal length as 3 and provides valid examples. However, the core of the solution, the proof that a sequence of length 4 is impossible, is flawed. The argument presented about two consecutive even numbers is incomplete and does not cover all cases. The crucial argument that one of any four consecutive integers must be a multiple of 4, and that such a number (if > 4) cannot be in D, was missed.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof / logical fallacy. The argument used to rule out sequences of length 4 is not general enough to be a valid proof."
