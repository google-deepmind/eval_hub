    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that the rationality of f(1/2^n) implies that the sequence of coefficients {a_i} is eventually periodic, and consequently that f(x) must be a rational function. The subsequent conclusion that f(2/q) is rational is also correct. However, the proof for the main claim about the denominator is flawed. The argument relies on the unsubstantiated assertion that \"no factors of 2 are introduced by Q(x)\". This is a major logical gap, as the proof requires demonstrating this property by analyzing the specific structure of the rational function f(x), which the student failed to do.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Unsupported assertion / logical gap."
