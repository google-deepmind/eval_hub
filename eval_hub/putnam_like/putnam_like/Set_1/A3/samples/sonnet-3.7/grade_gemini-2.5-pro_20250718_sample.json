    "comment": "The solution correctly establishes that the sequence of coefficients \\({a_i}\\) must be ultimately periodic and uses this fact to show that f(2/q) is a rational function. The subsequent argument that the denominator of the reduced fraction must be odd is also flawless and well-reasoned. A single point was deducted because the solution asserts that the rationality of f(1/2^n) implies the ultimate periodicity of \\({a_i}\\) without providing the justification based on the binary representation of f(1/2^n), which was a required first step in the rubric.",
