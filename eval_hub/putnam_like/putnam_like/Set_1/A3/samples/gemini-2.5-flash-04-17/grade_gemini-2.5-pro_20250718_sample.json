    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies that the rationality of $f(1/2^n)$ implies the sequence of coefficients $(a_i)$ must be eventually periodic. The function $f(x)$ is then correctly expressed as a rational function, and the case analysis is well-structured. The core logic for showing the denominator of $f(2/q)$ is odd is sound. A point was deducted for a minor algebraic error when combining the rational expressions for the pre-period and periodic parts. This mistake did not fundamentally alter the argument's conclusion but represents a small flaw in the execution.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Minor computational error. An algebraic mistake was made when finding the common denominator for the sum of the two parts of the function, leading to a slightly incorrect expression for the final fraction just before the conclusion."
