    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The argument proceeds logically from establishing the eventual periodicity of the coefficients `a_i` to expressing `f(x)` as a rational function. The final step, substituting `x=2/q` and analyzing the parity of the resulting fraction's denominator, is executed perfectly. The reasoning is clear, complete, and mathematically sound.",
