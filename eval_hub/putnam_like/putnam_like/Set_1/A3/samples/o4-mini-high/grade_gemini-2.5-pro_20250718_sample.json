    "comment": "The student provides a clear, well-structured, and complete solution. The key insight that the rationality of f(1/2^n) implies the sequence of coefficients (a_i) is eventually periodic is correctly identified and justified. The subsequent decomposition of f(x) into a rational function is elegant and correct. The final analysis of the denominator of f(2/q) is flawless, correctly showing that it must be odd. The solution meets all the requirements of the rubric.",
