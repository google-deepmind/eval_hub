    "comment": "The solution is outstanding. It is logically structured, rigorous, and flawlessly executed. The argument correctly establishes that the coefficient sequence must be eventually periodic, uses this to represent the function in a rational form, and correctly analyzes the properties of the resulting fraction at the specified points. The handling of the finite case as a special instance of the general periodic case is particularly elegant. A perfect score.",
