    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem. The key insight that the rationality of f(1/2^n) implies the eventual periodicity of the coefficient sequence (a_i) is correctly identified and used. The subsequent derivation of f(x) as a rational function is correct. The analysis of the denominator of f(2/q) is thorough and accurate, correctly showing that all contributing denominator factors are odd, which guarantees that the reduced fraction has an odd denominator. The reasoning is sound and well-presented throughout.",
