    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The method used is different from the one outlined in the rubric but is equally valid and elegant. The student correctly sets up and solves a recurrence for the fractional parts, uses this to find an expression for x_n, and then correctly computes the limit. The reasoning is clear and all steps are well-justified.",
