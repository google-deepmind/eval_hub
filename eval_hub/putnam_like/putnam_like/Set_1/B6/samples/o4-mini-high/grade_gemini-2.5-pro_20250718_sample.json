    "comment": "The student presents an alternative and elegant approach by rewriting the recurrence relation in terms of fractional parts and expressing the limit as an infinite series. This initial setup is correct and demonstrates a good understanding of the problem. However, the solution stops short of the required final closed-form answer. The attempt to make the series 'fully explicit' relies on a critical claim about the recurrence of the fractional parts, which is stated without proof and is incorrect. The solution thus misses the central step of the problem, which is to find a way to handle the sequence of floor/fractional terms, for which the rubric allocates the majority of the points.",
