    "comment": "The solution is flawless and provides a complete, rigorous proof. The student employs an alternative but equally valid method by constructing a 2D linear system of recurrences and proving its equivalence to the original problem. This approach is elegant and demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying mathematical structures. All steps, from deriving the linear recurrence to solving for the limit, are executed correctly.",
