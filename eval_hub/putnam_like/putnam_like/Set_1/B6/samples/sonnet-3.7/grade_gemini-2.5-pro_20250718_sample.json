    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant solution. The method used is different from the one anticipated in the rubric but is equally valid and rigorous. The key steps of reformulating the recurrence, solving it by finding a law for the fractional part, and evaluating the resulting limit are all executed perfectly. The final answer is correct.",
