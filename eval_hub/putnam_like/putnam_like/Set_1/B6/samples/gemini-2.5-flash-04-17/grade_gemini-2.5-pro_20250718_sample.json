    "comment": "The student correctly identifies some initial properties and rewrites the recurrence relation in a promising way ($x_{n+1} = (\\alpha+\\beta)x_n - \\{\\alpha x_n\\}$). However, the solution fails to make progress on the core part of the problem. The student does not find the linear recurrence relation for $x_n$, which is the central step worth 7 points. The student's attempts involve several lines of reasoning that are either abandoned, lead to incorrect conclusions (like the limit being 0), or are based on misremembered formulas. The final answer provided is incorrect and lacks a valid derivation.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Strategic Error: The solution fails to find the key insight of the problem, which is to convert the non-linear recurrence into a linear one. Conceptual Error: The student appears to misapply a known result from a similar problem. Incorrect Conclusion: The arguments used lead to incorrect intermediate results (e.g., that the limit is 0). Incorrect Final Answer: The final provided answer is wrong and is not supported by the work shown."
