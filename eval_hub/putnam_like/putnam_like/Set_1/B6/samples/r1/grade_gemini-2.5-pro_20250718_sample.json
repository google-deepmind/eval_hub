    "comment": "The final answer is correct. However, the solution does not follow the required derivation outlined in the rubric. It presents a high-level summary of claims for an alternative solution method without any mathematical justification or proof. The core of the argument, which involves deriving the linear recurrence relation for the sequence (worth 7 points), is completely absent. Credit is given only for reaching the correct final expression.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Missing Justification / Proof: The solution consists of a series of claims without any mathematical argument to support them. The entire derivation required by the grading scheme is omitted."
