    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and rigorous. The student correctly identifies an underlying linear recurrence, solves it, proves by induction that the original sequence is identical to this solution, and then computes the correct limit. The reasoning is clear and the calculations are accurate.",
