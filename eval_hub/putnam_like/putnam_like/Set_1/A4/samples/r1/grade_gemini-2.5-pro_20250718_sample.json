    "comment": "The solution correctly derives a key relation and establishes the upper bound for the group's order, $|G| \\leq 2n$. However, the main part of the proof, establishing the lower bound $|G| \\geq 2n$, is fundamentally flawed. The argument for the distinctness of elements relies on circular reasoning, assuming properties (like the order of x being n) that are only known after the order of the group is established. The proof of the non-abelian property contains a minor algebraic error, though the general idea is correct. The solution fails to follow the rigorous method of constructing a concrete model of the group (like the dihedral group) to prove the order, which is the central challenge of the problem and the bulk of the points in the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The proof for the order of the group contains a major logical flaw (circular reasoning). A calculation error is present in the non-abelian argument. The overall method deviates significantly from the rigorous approach required, failing to establish the lower bound on the group's order."
