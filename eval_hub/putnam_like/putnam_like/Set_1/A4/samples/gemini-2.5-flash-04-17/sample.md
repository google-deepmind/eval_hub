Let $G$ be the group defined by the presentation $\langle x, y : x^n=e, y^2=e, xyxy=e \rangle$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 3$.

First, we analyze the relations. We have:
1) $x^n = e$
2) $y^2 = e$
3) $xyxy = e$

From relation (2), $y$ is its own inverse, $y^{-1}=y$.
From relation (3), $xyxy = e$. Multiplying by $y$ on the right, $xyx = y$.
Multiplying by $x^{-1}$ on the left, $yx = x^{-1}y$.
This relation $yx = x^{-1}y$ is crucial. It allows us to rewrite any product of $x$ and $y$ such that all powers of $x$ appear to the left of powers of $y$. Consider a word in $x, y$. Any occurrence of $yx$ can be replaced by $x^{-1}y$, effectively moving $y$ to the right of $x$. Repeated application allows us to write any element in the form $x^a y^b$ for some integers $a, b$.

Using $x^n=e$, we can reduce the exponent $a$ modulo $n$, so $a \in \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$.
Using $y^2=e$, we can reduce the exponent $b$ modulo 2, so $b \in \{0, 1\}$.
Thus, any element in $G$ can be written in the form $x^k y^j$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$ and $j \in \{0, 1\}$.
This gives a list of at most $2n$ elements: $e, x, x^2, \dots, x^{n-1}, y, xy, x^2y, \dots, x^{n-1}y$.
This implies that $|G| \le 2n$.

Next, we show that these $2n$ elements are distinct. Assume $x^a y^b = x^c y^d$ where $0 \le a, c \le n-1$ and $b, d \in \{0, 1\}$.
Case 1: $b=d$. Then $x^a y^b = x^c y^b$. Multiplying by $y^{-b}$ on the right (which is $y^b$), we get $x^a = x^c$. Since $0 \le a, c \le n-1$ and $x^n=e$, this implies $a=c$. Thus, if $b=d$, the elements are equal only if $a=c$.

Case 2: $b \ne d$. WLOG, let $b=0$ and $d=1$. Then $x^a = x^c y$. This implies $y = x^{a-c}$. This means $y$ is a power of $x$, so $y \in \langle x \rangle$.
If $y \in \langle x \rangle$, then $G = \langle x, y \rangle = \langle x \rangle$, so $G$ is a cyclic group generated by $x$. The order of $G$ would be at most $n$.
However, we also have the relations $y^2=e$ and $xyxy=e$.
If $y=x^k$ for some integer $k$, then $y^2=e$ implies $(x^k)^2=e$, so $x^{2k}=e$.
The relation $xyxy=e$ becomes $x(x^k)x(x^k)=e$, which simplifies to $x^{1+k+1+k}=e$, so $x^{2+2k}=e$.
From $x^{2k}=e$ and $x^{2+2k}=e$, we can deduce $x^{(2+2k)-2k}=e$, which means $x^2=e$.
So, if $y$ is a power of $x$, it must be that $x^2=e$.
If $x^2=e$, then $x^{-1}=x$. The relation $yx=x^{-1}y$ becomes $yx=xy$.
So, if $y$ is a power of $x$, the group $G$ must be abelian, satisfying $x^n=e, y^2=e, x^2=e, xy=yx$.
Since $x^2=e$ and $x^n=e$, we must have $x^{\gcd(n,2)}=e$.
If $n$ is odd and $n \geq 3$, $\gcd(n,2)=1$. So $x^1=e$, which means $x=e$.
If $x=e$, the relations become $e^n=e, y^2=e, eye=e$, which simplifies to $y^2=e$. The group is $\langle y : y^2=e \rangle$, which is a cyclic group of order 2. Thus $|G|=2$.
However, we are given $n \geq 3$, so $|G|=2n \geq 2 \times 3 = 6$. The equation $2=2n$ implies $n=1$, which contradicts $n \geq 3$. So $x \ne e$ if $n$ is odd and $n \geq 3$.
If $n$ is even and $n \geq 3$, $n$ must be $4, 6, 8, \dots$. $\gcd(n,2)=2$. The condition $x^{\gcd(n,2)}=e$ becomes $x^2=e$.
The relations become $x^2=e, y^2=e, xy=yx$. This is the presentation of the direct product $C_2 \times C_2$, which is the Klein four-group. Its order is 4.
However, we know $|G|=2n$. Since $n$ is even and $n \geq 3$, the smallest possible value for $n$ is 4. Thus $|G|=2n \geq 2 \times 4 = 8$. The equation $4=2n$ implies $n=2$, which contradicts $n \geq 3$. So if $n$ is even and $n \ge 4$, the assumption that $y$ is a power of $x$ leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, for $n \geq 3$, $y$ cannot be a power of $x$. This means that the sets $\{x^k : 0 \le k \le n-1\}$ and $\{x^k y : 0 \le k \le n-1\}$ are disjoint.
The $2n$ elements $x^k y^j$ for $0 \le k \le n-1$ and $j \in \{0, 1\}$ are all distinct.
Thus, the order of the group $G$ is exactly $2n$.

Finally, we prove that $G$ is non-abelian for $n \geq 3$.
A group is non-abelian if there exist elements $a, b$ such that $ab \ne ba$.
Consider the elements $x$ and $y$. We have the relation $xyxy=e$.
Multiplying by $y$ on the right, $xyx = y$.
If $G$ were abelian, then $xy=yx$.
The relation $xyxy=e$ would become $(xy)(xy)=e$. If $xy=yx$, then $(yx)(yx)=e$, so $yxyx=e$. Since $xy=yx$, this is the same.
If $xy=yx$, then $xyxy = (xy)(xy) = (xy)^2 = e$.
Also, if $xy=yx$, the relation $xyx=y$ becomes $x(yx)=y$. Since $yx=xy$, $x(xy)=y$, so $x^2y=y$. Multiplying by $y^{-1}$ on the right, $x^2=e$.
So, if $G$ is abelian, it must satisfy $x^2=e$.
As shown in the previous part, the condition $x^2=e$ along with $x^n=e$ and $y^2=e$ implies:
If $n$ is odd and $n \geq 3$, then $x=e$, which makes $|G|=2$. But $|G|=2n \geq 6$. This is a contradiction.
If $n$ is even and $n \geq 3$, then $x^2=e$ is possible, but the relations imply $|G|=4$. But $|G|=2n \geq 8$. This is a contradiction.
In both cases (n odd or n even for $n \geq 3$), the assumption that $G$ is abelian leads to a contradiction with $|G|=2n$.
Therefore, $G$ must be non-abelian for $n \geq 3$.
For example, $xy \ne yx$. If $xy=yx$, then $x^2=e$, which is false for $n \ge 3$ according to our order calculation.

The group $G$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_n$, which is known to be a non-abelian group of order $2n$ for $n \geq 3$. The presentation $\langle r, s : r^n=e, s^2=e, (rs)^2=e \rangle$ is a standard presentation for $D_n$. Our presentation matches this exactly by setting $x=r$ and $y=s$, since $(xy)^2 = xyxy$.

In conclusion, we have shown that any element of $G$ can be uniquely written as $x^k y^j$ with $0 \le k \le n-1$ and $j \in \{0, 1\}$, establishing $|G|=2n$. We have also shown that the assumption of $G$ being abelian leads to a contradiction for $n \geq 3$, proving that $G$ is non-abelian.

The final answer is $\boxed{G}$ is a non-abelian group of order \( 2n \).
