Of course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step solution to the problem.

### **Problem Statement**

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n \geq 3$. Prove that the group $G$ defined by the presentation
$$
G = \langle x, y : x^n=e, y^2=e, xyxy=e \rangle
$$
is a non-abelian group of order $2n$.

### **Solution**

The proof will be structured in three main parts:
1.  We will show that the order of $G$, denoted by $|G|$, is at most $2n$.
2.  We will show that $|G|$ is at least $2n$. This will establish that $|G|=2n$.
3.  We will show that $G$ is non-abelian for $n \geq 3$.

#### **Part 1: Simplifying the Relations and Finding an Upper Bound for |G|**

First, let's analyze and simplify the given relations.
The relations are:
1.  $R_1: x^n = e$
2.  $R_2: y^2 = e$
3.  $R_3: xyxy = e$

From $R_2$, we have $y^2=e$. Multiplying by $y$ on the right, we get $y^2y=ey$, which simplifies to $y^3=y$. Multiplying by $y^{-1}$ gives $y=y^{-1}$. This means $y$ is its own inverse.

Now let's use this property in $R_3$:
$xyxy = e$
Multiply on the right by $y$:
$xyxy \cdot y = e \cdot y$
$xyx(y^2) = y$
Using $R_2 (y^2=e)$:
$xyx(e) = y$
$xyx = y$

This new relation, $xyx=y$, is very useful. Let's manipulate it further. Multiply on the left by $x^{-1}$:
$x^{-1}(xyx) = x^{-1}y$
$(x^{-1}x)yx = x^{-1}y$
$eyx = x^{-1}y$
$yx = x^{-1}y$

This final form, $yx = x^{-1}y$, is the key commutation-like rule between $x$ and $y$. Note that from $R_1$, we have $x^{-1} = x^{n-1}$. So we can also write $yx = x^{n-1}y$.

Now, any element of $G$ can be written as a "word" in the generators $x, y$ and their inverses. Since $y^{-1}=y$ and $x^{-1}=x^{n-1}$, any element of $G$ can be written as a product of powers of $x$ and $y$.

The relation $yx = x^{-1}y$ allows us to rewrite any word so that all powers of $x$ are on the left and all powers of $y$ are on the right. For example, consider a term $yx^k$:
$yx^k = (yx)x^{k-1} = (x^{-1}y)x^{k-1} = x^{-1}(yx)x^{k-2} = x^{-1}(x^{-1}y)x^{k-2} = x^{-2}yx^{k-2}$
By repeated application, we can show by induction that $yx^k = x^{-k}y$.

This means that any word, such as $x^{a_1}y^{b_1}x^{a_2}y^{b_2}\dots$, can be systematically simplified to the form $x^i y^j$ for some integers $i, j$.

Now we use the other relations to constrain $i$ and $j$:
-   $R_1: x^n=e$. This means that in the expression $x^i$, we only need to consider the exponent $i$ modulo $n$. So we can take $i \in \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$.
-   $R_2: y^2=e$. This means that in the expression $y^j$, we only need to consider the exponent $j$ modulo 2. So we can take $j \in \{0, 1\}$.

Therefore, every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^i y^j$ where $0 \leq i < n$ and $0 \leq j < 2$.
The set of these elements is $S = \{x^i y^j : 0 \leq i \leq n-1, j \in \{0,1\}\}$.
The number of elements in this set $S$ is $n \times 2 = 2n$.
Since every element of $G$ is equivalent to at least one element in $S$, the order of $G$ is at most $2n$.
$$|G| \le 2n$$

#### **Part 2: Finding a Lower Bound for |G|**

To show that $|G| \ge 2n$, we need to prove that all the $2n$ elements in the set $S$ are distinct. A standard way to do this is to find a concrete, well-known group of order $2n$ whose generators satisfy the relations of $G$.

Let's consider the **Dihedral Group $D_n$**, the group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon. This group has order $2n$. It is generated by two elements:
-   $r$, a rotation by $2\pi/n$. The order of $r$ is $n$, so $r^n=e$.
-   $s$, a reflection. The order of $s$ is 2, so $s^2=e$.

These generators satisfy the relation $srs = r^{-1}$.

Let's check if the generators $r$ and $s$ of $D_n$ satisfy the relations of our group $G$ if we map $x \mapsto r$ and $y \mapsto s$.
1.  $x^n=e \quad \rightarrow \quad r^n=e$. This is true in $D_n$.
2.  $y^2=e \quad \rightarrow \quad s^2=e$. This is also true in $D_n$.
3.  $xyxy=e \quad \rightarrow \quad srsr=e$. Let's check this. We know $srs=r^{-1}$. So,
    $srsr = (srs)r = (r^{-1})r = e$.
    This relation also holds true in $D_n$.

Since the generators of $D_n$ satisfy all the relations of $G$, by the universal property of group presentations (or Von Dyck's Theorem), there exists a surjective group homomorphism $\phi: G \to D_n$ defined by $\phi(x)=r$ and $\phi(y)=s$.

Because $\phi$ is surjective, the order of $G$ must be greater than or equal to the order of its homomorphic image, $D_n$.
$|G| \ge |\phi(G)| = |D_n| = 2n$.

Combining the results from Part 1 and Part 2:
-   $|G| \le 2n$
-   $|G| \ge 2n$

Therefore, we can conclude that the order of the group $G$ is exactly $2n$.
$$|G| = 2n$$
Furthermore, the homomorphism $\phi$ must be an isomorphism, so $G \cong D_n$.

#### **Part 3: Proving G is Non-Abelian**

A group is abelian if all its elements commute. To prove $G$ is non-abelian, we need to show that there exist at least two elements in $G$ that do not commute. Let's test the generators $x$ and $y$. The group $G$ is non-abelian if and only if $xy \neq yx$.

From Part 1, we derived the relation $yx = x^{-1}y$.
If $G$ were abelian, then $xy = yx$. Substituting our relation:
$xy = x^{-1}y$
Multiplying by $y^{-1}$ on the right (and since $y^{-1}=y$):
$xyy^{-1} = x^{-1}yy^{-1}$
$x(e) = x^{-1}(e)$
$x = x^{-1}$
Multiplying by $x$ on the right:
$x^2 = e$

So, the group $G$ is abelian if and only if $x^2=e$.

Now we need to determine if $x^2=e$ in $G$.
In Part 2, we established that $|G|=2n$ and that the elements of the set $S = \{x^i y^j : 0 \leq i \leq n-1, j \in \{0,1\}\}$ are all distinct.
This implies that the elements $e, x, x^2, \dots, x^{n-1}$ are all distinct. If they were not, for example if $x^i = x^k$ for $0 \le k < i < n$, then $x^{i-k}=e$ where $1 \le i-k < n$. This would mean the subgroup generated by $x$, $\langle x \rangle$, has order less than $n$, and consequently $|G|$ would be less than $2n$, a contradiction.
Therefore, the order of the element $x$ in $G$ is exactly $n$.

The condition for $G$ being abelian is $x^2=e$. Since the order of $x$ is $n$, this would imply that $n$ must divide 2. So $n$ could be 1 or 2.

However, the problem statement specifies that $n \ge 3$.
For $n \ge 3$, we have $n > 2$, so the order of $x$ is greater than 2. This means $x^2 \neq e$.
Since $x^2 \neq e$, the condition for $G$ being abelian is not met. Thus, $xy \neq yx$.

Therefore, the group $G$ is non-abelian for $n \ge 3$.

### **Conclusion**

We have successfully shown that:
1.  The relations of $G$ restrict its size to at most $2n$ elements of the form $x^i y^j$.
2.  By constructing a homomorphism from $G$ to the dihedral group $D_n$ (which has order $2n$), we showed that $|G|$ must be at least $2n$.
3.  Combining these two facts, we concluded that $|G|=2n$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_n$.
4.  We showed that $G$ is abelian if and only if $x^2=e$. Since the order of $x$ is $n$ and $n \ge 3$, $x^2 \neq e$. Therefore, $G$ is non-abelian.

This completes the proof.
