    "comment": "The solution is very well-structured and demonstrates a strong understanding of group presentations. The argument is almost perfect. The upper bound on the group order is correctly established. For the lower bound, the student correctly identifies the dihedral group D_n as a homomorphic image and correctly invokes Von Dyck's Theorem. The final part proving the group is non-abelian is also flawless. A single point was deducted for a calculational error when verifying that the generators of D_n satisfy the relation xyxy=e. Specifically, when checking if rsrs=e holds (with the mapping x\u21a6r, y\u21a6s), the calculation incorrectly manipulates the expression as `(srs)r` instead of the correct `r(srs)`.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Calculation error: There is a minor algebraic mistake in the verification step for the lower bound of the group's order. The student incorrectly manipulates the word `rsrs` when checking if it equals the identity in the dihedral group."
