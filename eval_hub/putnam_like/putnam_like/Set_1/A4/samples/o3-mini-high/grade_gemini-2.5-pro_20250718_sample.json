    "comment": "The solution correctly derives the relation $yx=x^{-1}y$ and uses this to correctly argue that the group has at most $2n$ elements (worth 2 points). The proof for non-abelianness is also correct (worth 1 point). However, the solution fails to rigorously prove that the order of the group is at least $2n$. Instead of constructing a specific group of order $2n$ that satisfies the relations (as outlined in the rubric), the student simply asserts that the presentation is that of the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ and uses its known order. This skips the main logical step required to establish the group's order from its presentation, for which the majority of points were allocated.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Gap in reasoning / Unjustified assertion. The solution's central claim, that the given presentation defines a group of order 2n, is asserted by recognizing the presentation as that of the dihedral group, rather than being proven from the given relations as required by the rubric's methodology."
