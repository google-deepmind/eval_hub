    "comment": "The student correctly derives the relation $xy = yx^{-1}$ from the group presentation and uses it to demonstrate that every element can be reduced to a standard form. This successfully establishes the upper bound on the group's order, $|G| \\leq 2n$. The argument for the group being non-abelian is also correct. However, the solution contains a significant logical flaw in its proof of the group's order. It asserts that the $2n$ elements are distinct without rigorous justification. This step is non-trivial and requires constructing a concrete group of order 2n that satisfies the given relations (as detailed in the rubric) to establish the lower bound $|G| \\geq 2n$. This core part of the proof is missing.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Gap / Missing Justification. The proof incorrectly assumes that because there are $2n$ possible forms for elements, the group must have order $2n$. It fails to prove that these forms represent distinct elements."
