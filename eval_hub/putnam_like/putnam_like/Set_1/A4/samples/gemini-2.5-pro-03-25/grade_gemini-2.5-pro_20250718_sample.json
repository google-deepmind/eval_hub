    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem. It correctly derives the relation yx = x\u207b\u00b9y, uses it to establish an upper bound |G| \u2264 2n, and then correctly uses the dihedral group D\u2082n and von Dyck's theorem to establish the lower bound |G| \u2265 2n. The order is thus correctly determined to be 2n. The proof of the non-abelian property for n \u2265 3 is also correct and well-argued. The solution is clear, logical, and complete.",
