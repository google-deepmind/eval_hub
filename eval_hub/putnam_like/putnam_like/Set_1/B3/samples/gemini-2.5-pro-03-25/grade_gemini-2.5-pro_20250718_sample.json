    "comment": "The solution is excellent and complete. It correctly identifies H\u00f6lder's inequality as the key tool and applies it flawlessly with clear justification for the choice of functions and exponents. The argument is well-structured, starting with a proof that the function is well-defined and ending with the correct application of logarithm properties to establish convexity. The handling of edge cases is also noted and correct.",
