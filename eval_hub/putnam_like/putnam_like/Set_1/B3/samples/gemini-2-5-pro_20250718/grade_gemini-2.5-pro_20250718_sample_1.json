    "comment": "The solution is flawless and exceptionally well-explained. The student correctly applies H\u00f6lder's inequality with the appropriate functions and conjugate exponents to establish the log-convexity of the norm, which is the key step. The subsequent application of logarithm properties to arrive at the final convexity inequality is also perfect. The reasoning is clear, rigorous, and easy to follow.",
