    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly identifies that the proof relies on showing the log-convexity of the L^s norm. They flawlessly apply H\u00f6lder's inequality with the correct setup and exponents. The subsequent use of logarithm properties to arrive at the definition of convexity for \u03a8 is also perfect. The argument is clear, correct, and well-structured.",
