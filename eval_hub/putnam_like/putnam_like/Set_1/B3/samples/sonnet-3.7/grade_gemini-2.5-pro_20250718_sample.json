    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof using an alternative, but equally valid, method. Instead of using H\u00f6lder's inequality directly as suggested by the rubric, the student effectively proves convexity by showing that the second derivative of the function is non-negative. The steps are logical, the calculations are accurate, and the final probabilistic interpretation to show non-negativity is particularly insightful. This demonstrates a strong command of the material.",
