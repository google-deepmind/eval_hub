    "comment": "The student provides a flawless and well-articulated proof using H\u00f6lder's inequality (labeled \"Proof 1\"). The application of the inequality is correct, and the subsequent use of logarithm properties to establish the convexity condition is also perfect. The solution aligns exactly with the steps outlined in the rubric, earning full points. The inclusion of a second, valid proof is commendable.",
