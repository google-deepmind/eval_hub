    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It begins by correctly establishing that the function $\\Psi(s)$ is well-defined for all $s \\in [p,q]$, which is a thoughtful preliminary step. The main proof correctly applies Holder's inequality to establish the key integral inequality and then correctly manipulates the logarithms to arrive at the definition of convexity. The reasoning is clear, detailed, and mathematically sound.",
