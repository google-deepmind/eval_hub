    "comment": "The student correctly reformulates the problem into a quadratic equation in n and establishes the important preliminary result that m > k. The analysis of the quadratic to deduce properties of the solutions is a valid approach. The argument for k <= n is partially correct but lacks full rigor for the general case. The main weakness is that the final conclusion for m <= 7k rests on a complicated quartic inequality that is presented without any derivation, which constitutes a major logical gap in the proof. Several concrete examples are checked correctly, which shows good intuition.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap / Unsubstantiated claim; Incomplete proof; Minor calculation error."
