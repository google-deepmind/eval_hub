    "comment": "The student correctly formulates the problem by expanding the sums into a valid quadratic equation in n, which earns points for the initial setup. However, the core of the proof for m \u2264 7k is missing and replaced by an unsubstantiated claim about the discriminant ('approximate analysis shows'). This is a fatal flaw as it bypasses the main algebraic challenge. A partial result, k \u2264 n (needed for 7k \u2264 7n), is correctly derived from a sound inequality, earning partial credit.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Fatal Flaw / Unsubstantiated Claim: The central argument relies on a hand-waving 'approximate analysis' instead of a rigorous mathematical proof. Logical Gap: The connection between derived inequalities and the conclusion k \u2264 n is not fully explained."
