    "comment": "The student presents a highly original and sophisticated proof that is almost entirely correct. The use of Taylor series to derive a quadratic equation in n, followed by an analysis of its roots, is an excellent alternative to the standard expansion method. The proof that m > k and therefore k <= n is elegant. The main argument for m <= 7k is a well-constructed proof by contradiction. A minor calculation error was made when simplifying the expression used to establish the contradiction, but fortunately the incorrect expression had the same necessary properties as the correct one, so the logical flow of the proof was not compromised. Overall, an outstanding solution.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Calculation error. There is a mistake in the algebraic simplification of a polynomial expression ('E/2') within the proof by contradiction. The final expression used is incorrect, although it still leads to the correct conclusion for the argument."
