    "comment": "Step 1 and Step 2 of the original solution were performed, then there is a total mess. Model mix the closed\u2010form sum-of-squares formula with \u201cTaylor expansions\u201d of that same polynomial in a way that is neither transparent nor justified, since at one point f is the sum-of-squares function and at another its formal derivative. Key claims - such as \u201cno integer solutions when d=2\u201d and \u201cfor d>=3, the smaller root n2\u200b falls in (0,1)\u201d - are asserted without proof. The cases d=2 and d>=3 are never fully analyzed via the quadratic\u2019s discriminant, and instead one sees only sketched estimates for the two roots.",
