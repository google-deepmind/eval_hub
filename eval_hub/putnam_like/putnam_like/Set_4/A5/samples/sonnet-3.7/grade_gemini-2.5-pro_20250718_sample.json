    "comment": "The student correctly sets up the problem by expressing the sums in terms of the standard sum-of-squares formula, earning the first two points. The proof of the second inequality, $7k \\leq 7n$, is also correct and well-argued. However, the proof of the first and main inequality, $m \\leq 7k$, follows an alternative method that, while valid in principle, is executed with multiple, critical calculation errors. The algebraic expansion of the polynomials is incorrect, and further errors are made in the subsequent evaluation. This undermines the entire argument for this part of the proof, so very little credit can be awarded for it, leading to a final score of 4.",
