    "comment": "The student presents a valid alternative approach by reformulating the problem as a quadratic equation in n. The proof for the second inequality, 7k \u2264 7n (by showing k \u2264 n), is concise and correct. However, the proof for the first inequality, m \u2264 7k, is not rigorous. It relies on an asymptotic analysis and verification of a single special case (k=1). While these methods provide strong evidence, they do not constitute a complete proof as required by the problem. The solution does not follow the algebraic manipulation path outlined in the rubric to obtain a rigorous bound.",
