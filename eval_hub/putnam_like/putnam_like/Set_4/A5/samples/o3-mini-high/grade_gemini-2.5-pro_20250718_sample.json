    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the formula for the sum of squares and uses it to set up the main equation. However, the solution fails to provide any of the required algebraic manipulation to prove the core inequality $m \\le 7k$. The proof is replaced by a statement that the result can be obtained 'after some algebra'. Additionally, the argument for the second inequality $7k \\le 7n$ is logically flawed, as it omits the essential step of proving that $k \\le n$.",
