    "comment": "The solution is based on an analysis of a polynomial in n, but it coefficients depend on m and k. In particular, it is not necessarily true that f(m)<=0 and hence the reasoning is not clear. The model mistakenly evaluates f at n=m and then sets m=k, instead of directly computing f(k). Since f is a quadratic in n (with m, k fixed), to show k lies between its roots one must check f(k)<0. By using f(m) and only afterward replacing m=k, the model actually proves a different inequality than the required f(k)<0.",
