    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. The student uses a different but equally valid and rigorous method compared to the one outlined in the rubric. The key steps, including deriving a correct polynomial equation, using properties of quadratics to establish f(m) <= 0, and proving m <= 7k by contradiction, are all executed flawlessly. The argument for k < n is also sound. An excellent and well-structured solution.",
