    "comment": "The solution is completely correct. The student successfully sums the equations and correctly rearranges them into a sum of non-negative terms that equals zero. The subsequent argument that each term must be zero, which implies x_i=1 for all i, is also sound. While the algebraic manipulation differs from the provided rubric's suggested path, the student's method is mathematically valid and leads to the correct unique solution. No errors were found.",
