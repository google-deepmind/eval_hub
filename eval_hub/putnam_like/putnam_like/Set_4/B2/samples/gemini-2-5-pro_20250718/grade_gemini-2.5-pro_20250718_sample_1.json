    "comment": "The solution is flawless and very well-detailed. The student correctly sums the equations and rearranges them into a sum of squares equal to zero. The subsequent analysis to show that x=1 is the unique solution to the resulting equation is also correct and rigorously justified using a calculus-based argument. The final verification step demonstrates thoroughness. Overall, an excellent and complete solution.",
