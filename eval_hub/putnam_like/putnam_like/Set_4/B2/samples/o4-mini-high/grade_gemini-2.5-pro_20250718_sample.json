    "comment": "The solution is very well-structured and demonstrates a strong understanding of the core strategy. The main step of summing the equations and reformulating the result as a sum of squares is executed flawlessly, earning the full 8 points for that part. However, the final part of the argument is incomplete. While the equation x(1+ln(x))=1 is correctly derived and the solution x=1 is identified, the student fails to provide any justification for why this solution is unique, which is explicitly required by the rubric. A complete solution would analyze the monotonicity of the relevant functions. This omission results in a 1-point deduction.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete justification. The solution correctly identifies the final equation for each variable but does not provide a proof or argument for the uniqueness of its solution."
