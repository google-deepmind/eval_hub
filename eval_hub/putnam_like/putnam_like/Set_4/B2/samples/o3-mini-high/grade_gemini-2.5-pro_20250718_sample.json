    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the final solution. The strategy of reducing the system to a sum of squares is hinted at, but the derivation provided is fundamentally flawed. The student incorrectly generalizes an identity from a constant solution case and asserts it holds term-by-term for the variable case after summation, which is not what happens. This invalid reasoning skips the entire 8-point argument. For the final 2-point part, the student correctly sets up the equation x(1+ln x)=1 and finds the solution x=1. However, the proof for the uniqueness of this solution is incomplete, as the derivative is computed but not fully analyzed. I am awarding 2 points for correctly identifying the final algebraic equation to be solved for each variable and finding its root.",
