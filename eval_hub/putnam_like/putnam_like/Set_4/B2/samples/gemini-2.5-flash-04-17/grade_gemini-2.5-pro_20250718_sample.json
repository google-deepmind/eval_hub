    "comment": "The solution is correct and well-argued. The student successfully transforms the system by summing the equations, leading to a sum of squares that must be zero. The algebraic manipulation, though slightly different from the provided rubric's path, is sound and leads to the correct intermediate equation. The subsequent analysis to show that x=1 is the unique solution to the resulting equation is rigorous and complete, using a valid calculus-based argument. The logic is flawless.",
