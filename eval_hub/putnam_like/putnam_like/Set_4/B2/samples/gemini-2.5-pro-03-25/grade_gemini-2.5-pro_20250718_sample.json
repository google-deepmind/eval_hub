    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. After summing the equations, the student does not recognize the expression as a sum of squares as suggested by the rubric. Instead, they embark on a more laborious but entirely valid path using calculus to prove that each term in the sum is non-negative and is zero only when x=1. This alternative method is rigorous and successfully demonstrates that the unique solution is (1, 1, ..., 1). The final verification step is also included. The solution is flawless.",
