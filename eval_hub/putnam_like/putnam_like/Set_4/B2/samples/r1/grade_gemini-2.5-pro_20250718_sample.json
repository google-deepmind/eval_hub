    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the solution (1,1,...,1) by assuming all variables are equal and verifies it. The analysis in Step 4, which shows that c=1 is the unique solution to the equation c(1+ln c)=1, is sound and matches the second part of the rubric. However, the core of the proof, which is to show that ALL solutions must have all variables equal, is missing. The student asserts this in Step 6 by mentioning summing the equations, but does not perform the required algebraic manipulation to create a sum of squares, which is the main challenge of the problem and worth 8 points. Additionally, there is a calculation error in Step 3.",
