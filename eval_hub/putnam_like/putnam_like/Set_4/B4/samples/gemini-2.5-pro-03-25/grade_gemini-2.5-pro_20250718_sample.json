    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and rigorous proof. However, the method used\u2014direct computation via spherical coordinates and Gamma functions\u2014is substantially different from and more laborious than the elegant, intended solution based on symmetry and Jensen's inequality, as outlined in the grading rubric. While the final result is correct, points are deducted for not demonstrating the key insights the problem was designed to test. The proof itself is flawless.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation: The solution is mathematically sound but does not follow the intended path outlined in the rubric, instead opting for a more complex direct calculation."
