    "comment": "The solution provides a complete and correct proof. While it does not follow the method suggested in the rubric (symmetry argument and Jensen's inequality), it uses an alternative and equally valid approach of direct computation. The integral is evaluated exactly using spherical coordinates and a recurrence relation derived from the divergence theorem. The final inequality is then proven rigorously. The method demonstrates a high level of mathematical skill.",
