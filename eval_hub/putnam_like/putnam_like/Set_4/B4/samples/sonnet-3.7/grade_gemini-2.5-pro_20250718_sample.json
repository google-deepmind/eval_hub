    "comment": "The solution is complete and mathematically correct. Although the approach taken is different from the one outlined in the grading scheme (direct computation vs. symmetry and Jensen's inequality), it is a perfectly valid and rigorous method. The student demonstrates excellent command of multivariable calculus, special functions (Beta and Gamma), and inequalities to arrive at the correct conclusion. Full marks are awarded for a flawless and impressive alternative proof.",
