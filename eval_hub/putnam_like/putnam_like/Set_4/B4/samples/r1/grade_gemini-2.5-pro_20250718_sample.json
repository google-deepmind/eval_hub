    "comment": "The provided solution is mathematically sound and constitutes a valid alternative proof. However, the score is based on a specific grading rubric which awards points for a method involving a symmetry argument and Jensen's inequality. The student's solution, which relies on direct computation using polar coordinates and properties of the Gamma function, does not follow the steps outlined in the rubric. Consequently, no points can be awarded according to the provided grading scheme.",
