    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. Although the method (direct calculation using spherical coordinates and Beta functions) is different from the one outlined in the grading scheme (which uses an averaging argument and Jensen's inequality), the student's approach is mathematically sound, rigorous, and demonstrates a high level of understanding. The argument is well-structured and all steps are correctly justified.",
