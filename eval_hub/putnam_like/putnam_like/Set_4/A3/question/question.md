Let $n \geq 2$. It is known that for every symmetric matrix $A \in \mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{R})$ all its eigenvalues are positive if and only if all leading principal minors are positive. Let $p \in \mathbb{P}$ be a prime number. We say that an element $x \in \mathbb{F}_p$ is positive if and only if it is a square of another element in $\mathbb{F}_p$ (namely, there is $y \in \mathbb{F}_p$ such that $x=y^2$).
 
 Assume that $A \in \mathbb{M}_n (\mathbb{F}_p)$ is symmetric and all its eigenvalues are in $\mathbb{F}_p$.
 
 Is that true that all eigenvalues of a $A$ are positive in $\mathbb{F}_p$ if and only if all its leading principal minors are positive in $\mathbb{F}_p$? If yes, prove it. If not, then which implication doesn't hold?
