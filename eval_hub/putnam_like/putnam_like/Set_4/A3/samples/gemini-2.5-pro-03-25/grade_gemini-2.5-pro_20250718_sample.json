    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies that the statement is false in general. It correctly handles the special case of p=2 where the statement holds trivially. For p>2, the student correctly identifies the 'positive' (square) elements in their chosen field F_5 and provides valid and well-explained counterexamples to disprove both implications of the equivalence. The logic is sound and the calculations are accurate.",
