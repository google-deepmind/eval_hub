    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that the equivalence does not hold and provides a correct, well-reasoned counterexample for the implication 'if all leading principal minors are positive, then all eigenvalues are positive'. This part of the solution is worth 6 points (2 for setup, 4 for the counterexample). However, the student incorrectly claims that the converse is true. The provided \"proof\" for this false statement is flawed, and the student fails to find a counterexample for this second implication, for which the remaining 4 points were allocated.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual error: The student incorrectly claims one implication holds when it is false, showing a misunderstanding of how properties of real matrices translate to finite fields. Proof error: The attempted proof of the false statement is invalid. Omission: The solution is incomplete as it misses the counterexample for the second implication."
