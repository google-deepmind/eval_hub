    "comment": "The student presents a conceptually correct high-level argument by identifying that the minimum occurs at the symmetric point ($a_i = 1/n$) and that this follows from the convexity of the function $f(a)=(a+1/a)^p$ (what the student calls a 'smoothing' argument). However, the solution omits the actual proof of convexity, which accounts for 7 points in the rubric. The student only sketches a method for the proof without performing any of the required calculations. The final step of substituting $a_i=1/n$ to find the minimum value is done correctly. The alternative proof for $p \\ge 1$ is valid but does not cover the full scope of the problem.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Proof / Missing Justification: The central claim of the argument, which is the convexity of a function, is asserted and sketched but not rigorously proven as required by the grading scheme."
