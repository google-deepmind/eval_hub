    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the function and the general approach using Jensen's inequality. The application of the inequality and the final algebraic simplification are correct. However, the solution fails to provide a rigorous proof for the convexity of the function $f(x)$. The argument for $p \\geq 1$ is stated without calculation, and the crucial case of $0 < p < 1$ is dismissed with a non-rigorous hand-waving argument, which constitutes a major gap in the proof.",
