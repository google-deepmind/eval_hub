    "comment": "The student provides a correct and complete proof, but it is split into two cases with different methods. For the case p \u2265 1, the solution perfectly matches the rubric's method of proving convexity and applying Jensen's inequality. However, for the more complex case 0 < p < 1, the solution uses Lagrange Multipliers instead of the required method of proving convexity on the restricted domain (0,1). The rubric allocates 5 points for this specific convexity proof, which the student did not attempt. While the student's alternative method is valid, points are awarded based on the provided rubric. The student earned points for the p \u2265 1 case and for the final algebraic conclusion, but missed the main 5 points for the 0 < p < 1 case.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation. For the case 0 < p < 1, the student used a valid but different method (Lagrange Multipliers) than the one specified in the grading rubric (proving convexity on a restricted domain and using Jensen's inequality)."
