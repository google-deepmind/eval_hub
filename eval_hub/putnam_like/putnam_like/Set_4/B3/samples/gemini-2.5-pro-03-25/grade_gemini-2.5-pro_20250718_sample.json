    "comment": "The solution is flawless and demonstrates a deep understanding of convexity and Jensen's inequality. The student correctly defines the function f(x) and computes its second derivative. The analysis of the sign of f''(x) is conducted rigorously by examining a quadratic in 1/x^2. The two cases, p>=1 and 0<p<1, are handled perfectly. For the case 0<p<1, the student correctly identifies that f(x) is not convex everywhere but correctly argues that it is convex on the domain relevant to the problem, (0,1], which is sufficient. The application of Jensen's inequality and the final algebraic steps are all correct. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and more detailed than the provided rubric.",
