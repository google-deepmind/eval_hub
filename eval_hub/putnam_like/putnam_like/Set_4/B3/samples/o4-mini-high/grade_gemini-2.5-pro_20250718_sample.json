    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the function to analyze and uses a valid 'smoothing' argument, which is equivalent to applying Jensen's inequality for a convex function. The final calculation based on this assumption is also correct. However, the solution completely omits the proof of convexity, which is the most substantial part of the problem and is worth 7 points in the rubric. The student merely asserts it is true with 'a direct check shows...'. Furthermore, the assertion that the function is convex on all of (0, infinity) for any p>0 is false for the case p in (0,1), which is a significant error.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major omission of proof; incorrect mathematical claim."
