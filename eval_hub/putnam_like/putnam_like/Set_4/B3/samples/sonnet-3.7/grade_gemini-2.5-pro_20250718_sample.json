    "comment": "The student correctly sets up the problem using Lagrange multipliers and finds the correct critical point ($a_i = 1/n$). The final algebraic calculation to arrive at the desired inequality is also correct. However, the central argument used to justify that this point corresponds to a minimum is critically flawed. The claim that the function $h(a)$ is strictly increasing for all $a > 0$ and $p > 0$ is incorrect; it fails for the case where $p \\in (0,1)$. This unsupported (and false) assertion invalidates the proof for a large part of the problem's scope.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical error: The solution makes a key claim about the monotonicity of a function which is not generally true for the given conditions ($p \\in (0,1)$). This invalidates the argument that the found critical point is the unique solution. The justification for monotonicity was also insufficient even for the cases where it holds ($p \\ge 1$)."
