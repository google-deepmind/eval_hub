    "comment": "The solution correctly answers \"yes\". The proof that any bounded sequence with the disjoint ball property satisfies the limit condition is correct (Step 1). The argument for the existence of such a sequence (Step 2) correctly identifies that the sum of the areas of the balls is finite, which is the key insight. However, the solution fails to provide a rigorous construction of such a sequence, instead appealing to a \"known result from packing theory\". This is a major logical gap, as the construction is the most challenging part of the problem and constitutes the bulk of the points in the grading scheme.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Gap / Missing Proof: The solution relies on a non-trivial packing theorem without proof or justification, failing to provide the explicit construction required to fully answer the question."
