    "comment": "The solution provides a correct and complete proof. The construction of the sequence using a greedy-packing algorithm is valid and different from the one in the rubric, but equally effective. The subsequent proof that the integral condition holds is rigorous, correctly applying the uniform continuity of the function on a compact set. The argument is well-structured and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem.",
