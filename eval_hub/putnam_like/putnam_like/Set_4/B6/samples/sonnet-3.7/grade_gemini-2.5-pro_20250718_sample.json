    "comment": "The student concludes that such a sequence does not exist, which is the opposite of the correct answer. The proof attempts to build a counterexample by constructing a continuous function \u03c6 for which the limit condition fails. While the integral calculation is correct, the argument contains a critical flaw: the constructed function \u03c6 is not guaranteed to be continuous. Specifically, if the sequence of centers (z_n) has a limit point (as is the case in the correct solution), the constructed \u03c6 will be discontinuous at that point. The student's proof only works for sequences where |z_n| \u2192 \u221e, but the problem asks if any such sequence exists.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect Conclusion; Logical Flaw. The proof's central claim of continuity for the constructed function \u03c6 is false for the type of sequence that would satisfy the problem's conditions."
