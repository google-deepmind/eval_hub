    "comment": "The student incorrectly concludes that no such sequence exists. The provided reasoning attempts to build a counterexample by constructing a specific continuous function \\(\\varphi\\), but this construction is flawed. The constructed \\(\\varphi\\) is not guaranteed to be continuous for all possible sequences \\((z_n)\\), especially if the centers \\(z_n\\) have an accumulation point. More fundamentally, the argument fails to consider the case where the centers of the balls converge to a point (e.g., the origin), which is the key idea behind the correct 'Yes' answer. The solution demonstrates a misunderstanding of the logical structure of the problem and makes no progress towards the correct construction.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect conclusion, flawed logical reasoning (misunderstanding of quantifiers), incomplete analysis (failure to consider all cases for the sequence)."
