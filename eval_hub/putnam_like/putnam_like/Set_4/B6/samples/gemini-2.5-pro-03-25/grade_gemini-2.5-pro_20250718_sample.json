    "comment": "The solution is excellent and entirely correct. The student provides a valid, non-constructive proof that is different from the rubric's specific construction but equally rigorous. The argument correctly identifies that the sequence of centers $(z_n)$ must be bounded, proves that any such bounded sequence satisfies the condition, and justifies the existence of such a sequence by correctly noting the finite total area of the balls. The inclusion of a counterexample for unbounded sequences further demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. The reasoning is clear, logical, and complete.",
