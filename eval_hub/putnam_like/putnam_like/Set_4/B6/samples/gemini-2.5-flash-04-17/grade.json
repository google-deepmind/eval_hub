    "comment": "The model claims that the sequence (z_n) has to be unbounded, which is not true (it claims that it follows from some theory). Moreover, there are errors - mean-value theorem for integrals in one variable does not immediately extend to arbitrary planar domains but even if such c_n exists it depends on \\varphi. ",
