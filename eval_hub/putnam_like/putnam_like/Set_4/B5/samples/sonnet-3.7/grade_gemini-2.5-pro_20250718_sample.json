    "comment": "The student correctly proved that the function f must be an involution and additive (and therefore Q-linear). The verification that any linear operator A with A^2=I is a solution is also correct. However, the solution is incomplete as it misses the main part of the argument: the characterization of all such linear involutions through the direct sum decomposition of the vector space V into the eigenspaces corresponding to eigenvalues +1 and -1. This decomposition is the core of the full solution and is worth a significant portion of the points.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof / Missing argument. The solution correctly identifies the necessary properties of the function (linearity and being an involution) but fails to provide the full characterization of such functions using the direct sum decomposition of the space, which is a major part of the solution."
