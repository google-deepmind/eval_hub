    "comment": "The solution correctly establishes that the function must be a Q-linear involution ($f(f(z))=z$) and provides a correct verification that any such function is a solution. However, it fails to prove the central theorem that any such involution admits a direct sum decomposition of the vector space into its +1 and -1 eigenspaces, instead stating it as a known fact. This omission constitutes a significant gap in the argument as detailed by the rubric.",
