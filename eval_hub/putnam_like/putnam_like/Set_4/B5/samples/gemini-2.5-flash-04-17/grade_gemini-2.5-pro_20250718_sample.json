    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It follows a slightly different, but equally rigorous, path than the rubric for the first two steps, demonstrating a strong command of the material. The student correctly shows that f(0)=0 and then f^2=id, which then quickly leads to additivity. The characterization of linear involutions via a direct sum decomposition is flawless and well-explained. The final verification that these conditions are sufficient is also correct. A full score is warranted.",
