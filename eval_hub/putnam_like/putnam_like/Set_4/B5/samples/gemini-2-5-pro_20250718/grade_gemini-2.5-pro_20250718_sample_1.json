    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly proves that f must be an involutory linear transformation and then fully characterizes all such transformations as reflections defined by a direct sum decomposition of the vector space V. The logical flow is clear, and all steps are rigorously justified. The methods used to prove that f is an involution and that f is additive are particularly elegant and demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic.",
