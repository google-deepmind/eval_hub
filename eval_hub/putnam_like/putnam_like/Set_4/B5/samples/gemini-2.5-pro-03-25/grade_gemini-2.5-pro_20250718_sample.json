    "comment": "The solution correctly establishes that any solution f must be a Q-linear map satisfying f^2 = I (an involution). The initial steps to prove f(f(z))=z and the additivity of f are sound, though they follow a different path than the rubric. The verification that any Q-linear involution is a solution is also correct. However, a significant portion of the credit is for the characterization of all such linear involutions. The solution states the result\u2014that these functions correspond to a direct sum decomposition V = A \u2295 B\u2014but does not provide the derivation. The rubric requires showing how any such f gives rise to this decomposition via its eigenspaces, which is a major part of the problem that was omitted.",
