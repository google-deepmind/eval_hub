    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies that the solutions are Q-linear involutions. The steps to prove that a solution must be an involution ($f^2=id$) and additive are correct. The check that any linear involution is a solution is also correct. However, a major part of the proof, which involves showing that any linear involution can be characterized by a direct sum decomposition V = U\u2295W, has been omitted. The solution states this structural result without providing the required derivation (i.e., constructing the eigenspaces and showing they decompose V), which is the most heavily weighted part of the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Missing Justification: The solution states the canonical form of a linear involution (reflection across a subspace corresponding to a direct sum decomposition) without deriving this structure from the properties f^2=id and linearity. Minor Logical Flaw: The initial argument for f(0)=0 is not fully rigorous."
