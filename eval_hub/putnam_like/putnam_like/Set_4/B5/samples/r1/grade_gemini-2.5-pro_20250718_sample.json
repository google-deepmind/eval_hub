    "comment": "The student correctly proved that the function must be an involution ($f \\circ f = \\mathrm{id}$) and additive, which together imply it is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear involution. This corresponds to the first two parts of the rubric, earning 2 points. However, the solution stops there. The main part of the problem, worth 8 points, is to characterize all such linear involutions in terms of the direct sum decomposition of the space into eigenspaces ($V = A \\oplus B$) and to prove that any such decomposition yields a valid solution. This crucial analysis is completely missing.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major omission: The solution identifies the properties of the function (linear involution) but fails to provide the complete characterization of all such functions as required by the problem and detailed in the rubric. The converse statement is also asserted without proof."
