    "comment": "The student's solution does not follow any of the steps outlined in the grading rubric. The approach taken, which involves bounding individual terms on the right-hand side, contains a fundamental logical flaw. The proof attempts to use the same terms from the left-hand side (e.g., x(2n)!) to bound multiple different terms on the right-hand side, which is an invalid method of reasoning for inequalities. While the identification of the equality case (n=m=k) is correct, it does not contribute to a valid proof structure. As none of the rubric's required insights or methods are present, no points can be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Fallacy, Incorrect Proof Structure. The core argument repeatedly uses the same terms on the left-hand side to establish bounds for different terms on the right-hand side, which is invalid."
