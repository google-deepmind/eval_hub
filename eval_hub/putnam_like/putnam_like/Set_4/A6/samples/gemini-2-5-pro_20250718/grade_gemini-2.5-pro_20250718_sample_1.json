    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. The solution is very well-structured and demonstrates a high level of mathematical insight. The method, which relies on a decomposition related to Schur's inequality, is different from the one in the rubric but is entirely valid and arguably more general. The student correctly proves the necessary helper inequalities and handles all cases with rigor. The overall presentation is excellent.",
