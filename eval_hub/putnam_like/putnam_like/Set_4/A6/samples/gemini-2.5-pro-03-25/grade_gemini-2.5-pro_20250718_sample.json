    "comment": "The solution uses a valid alternative method by reducing the problem to checking the vertices of the domain $[1,4]^3$. The auxiliary inequalities and the verification for 5 of the 8 vertices are correct and well-argued. The proof for the remaining 3 vertices is correctly started and one of the two sub-cases (derived from Karamata's inequality) is successfully proven. However, the proof for the second sub-case is missing, which creates a significant gap in the overall argument. The submitted work is very strong but incomplete.",
