    "comment": "The student presents an elegant and valid alternative solution by reducing the problem to checking the vertices of the cube `[1,4]^3`. The proof for the 'base case' (where x=y=z) using the log-convexity of the Gamma function is correct and insightful. This approach is a valid substitute for the main argument in the rubric. However, the solution is incomplete because it does not rigorously prove the inequality for the other vertices. The justification for the single case checked, `(1,1,4)`, is hand-waved and relies on an unstated, non-trivial inequality (Popoviciu's), and the other cases are omitted entirely. This lack of completeness in the final part of the argument warrants a deduction.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete argument; Missing justification. The solution correctly outlines a valid proof strategy but fails to rigorously execute the final step, asserting that the inequality holds for the majority of required cases without providing a full proof or justification."
