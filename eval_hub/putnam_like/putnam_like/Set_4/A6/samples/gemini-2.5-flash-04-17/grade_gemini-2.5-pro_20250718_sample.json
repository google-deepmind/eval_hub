    "comment": "The student presents a valid and creative alternative solution by analyzing the expression as a linear function of $(x,y,z)$ and testing the vertices of the domain $[1,4]^3$. The reduction of the problem to a single new factorial inequality (for the non-trivial vertices) is executed correctly, including the key insight that sums like $(2n)!+(2m)!-2(n+m)!$ are non-negative. However, the final step, a proof of this new inequality, is missing; the student only verifies it for special cases. The solution is thus incomplete.",
