    "comment": "The student correctly rearranges the inequality to the form $xA+yB+zC \\geq 0$ and verifies the simple case where n=m=k. However, the main argument of the proof is critically flawed. The student incorrectly assumes that $xA+yB+zC \\geq A+B+C$, which is not true in general as the coefficients A, B, and C are not necessarily positive. The solution does not follow the path outlined in the rubric (using Gamma functions and their integral representation) and the alternative approach attempted is unsuccessful.",
