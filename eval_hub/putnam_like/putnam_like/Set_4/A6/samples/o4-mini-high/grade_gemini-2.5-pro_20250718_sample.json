    "comment": "The student presents a creative and valid alternative approach by correctly identifying that the inequality is linear in (x,y,z) and its minimum must occur at a vertex of the domain. The use of symmetry to reduce the number of cases is also excellent. The proofs for the (1,1,1) and (1,1,4) vertices are correct and well-argued. However, the proof for the crucial (1,4,4) vertex case contains a significant error and a non-sequitur, which invalidates the argument for that case and thus the overall conclusion. A substantial portion of the proof is correct and demonstrates strong mathematical insight, warranting significant partial credit.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof; Logical error. The proof for the (1,4,4) vertex case contains a major algebraic error and a conclusion that does not follow from the preceding steps, rendering this part of the proof invalid."
