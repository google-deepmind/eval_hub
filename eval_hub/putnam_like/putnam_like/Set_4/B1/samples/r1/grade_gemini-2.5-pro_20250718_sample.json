    "comment": "The solution is excellent. For part (a), the student correctly constructs the polynomial P and verifies the identity. For part (b), the student provides a valid proof by contradiction. They correctly derive the necessary form of Q(x) and accurately argue that this rational function cannot be a polynomial, leading to the correct conclusion. The reasoning is clear and mathematically sound throughout.",
