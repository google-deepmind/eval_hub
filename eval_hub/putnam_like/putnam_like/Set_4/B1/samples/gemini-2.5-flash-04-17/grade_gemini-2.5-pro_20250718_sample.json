    "comment": "The solution for part (a) is excellent and fully rigorous. The argument for part (b) is also very strong, using a valid change-of-variable and identity principle argument. The overall logic is correct and leads to the right conclusion. A minor deduction is made for two small errors in the execution: a notational error in writing the denominator of the resulting rational function (coefficients were swapped, though this did not affect the degree argument) and a slightly flawed justification for the degree of the numerator.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Minor Notational Error: In part (b), the constant and quadratic coefficients ('c' and 'e') were swapped in the denominator of the derived rational function. Minor Logical Flaw: The justification for the numerator's degree being 1 was based on the wrong coefficient ('a' instead of 'b'), although the overall conclusion that the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's was sound."
