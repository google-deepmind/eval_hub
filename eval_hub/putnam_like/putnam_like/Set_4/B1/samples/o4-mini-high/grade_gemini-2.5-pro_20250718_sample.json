    "comment": "The solution is excellent. For part (a), the correct polynomial is constructed and verified. For part (b), the student presents a correct and elegant argument, different from the one in the rubric but equally valid. They correctly show that the hypothetical polynomial Q must be identical to a specific rational function which cannot be a polynomial, leading to a contradiction. The reasoning is clear and well-executed.",
