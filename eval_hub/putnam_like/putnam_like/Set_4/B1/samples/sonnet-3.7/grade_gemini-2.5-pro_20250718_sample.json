    "comment": "The solution is excellent. Part (a) is solved correctly by constructing the required polynomial. Part (b) provides a clear and valid proof by contradiction. The method used in part (b) is slightly different from the rubric's but is equally rigorous: it correctly derives the functional form of the hypothetical polynomial Q and shows that it must be a non-polynomial rational function, which is a contradiction. The reasoning is sound and well-explained.",
