    "comment": "The solution is excellent and fully correct. For part (a), the student correctly identifies that the polynomial P must have degree at most 2 by analyzing the behavior of the expression at k=0, and then correctly finds its coefficients by using the identity principle for polynomials. For part (b), the student provides two different, complete, and rigorous proofs for why no such polynomial Q exists. The first proof correctly analyzes the behavior of the expressions for all integers including k=0, while the second (alternative) proof correctly establishes a polynomial identity that must hold for all real numbers and derives a contradiction from it. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and demonstrates a strong command of the concepts.",
