Suppose that $P_1$ and $P_2$ are polynomials of real coefficients of degree $1$ and $2$, respectively, with $0 \not\in P_2 (\mathbb{Z})$.

* Does there exist a polynomial $P$ of real coefficients such that $k^2 P\left( \frac{1}{k} \right) = P_2(k)$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$?

* Does there exist a polynomial $Q$ of real coefficients such that $\frac{1}{k} Q \left( \frac{1}{k} \right) = \frac{P_1(k)}{P_2(k)}$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$?
