    "comment": "The solution is excellent, detailed, and mathematically rigorous. All roots are correctly identified using a sound inductive argument. The implication that the remaining polynomial factor Q(x) must be constant is perfectly justified. The final form of the polynomial is correctly stated and thoroughly verified. The solution successfully addresses all aspects of the problem and meets all criteria outlined in the rubric.",
