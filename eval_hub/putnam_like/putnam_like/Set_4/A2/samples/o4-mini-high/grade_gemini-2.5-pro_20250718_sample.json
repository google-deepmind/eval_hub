    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the family of polynomial solutions and includes the trivial zero polynomial. However, the reasoning provided is incomplete and contains a major logical gap. The argument correctly finds the degree of any non-zero solution, but it fails to prove that the solution must have the specific roots 0, 2, 4, ..., 2022. Instead, it posits the correct form of the solution and states it can be verified, without showing that these are the only possible solutions (uniqueness). The core of the proof, as detailed in the rubric's 6-point step, is missing. Points are awarded for identifying the correct final form of the polynomial and for the verification step.",
