    "comment": "The solution is excellent and very well-written. The student correctly identifies all the roots of the polynomial through a clear and logical iterative process. The argument that the remaining polynomial factor must be a constant is also correct. The final form of the polynomial is correctly identified. The only point deducted is for the omission of the verification step, which is required to show that all polynomials of the derived form are indeed solutions.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a required step (verification)."
