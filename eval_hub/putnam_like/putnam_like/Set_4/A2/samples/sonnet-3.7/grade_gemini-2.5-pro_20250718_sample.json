    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies all the necessary roots of the polynomial (0, 2, 4, ..., 2022) and deduces the correct general form. The argument that the remaining polynomial factor S(x) must be periodic and therefore constant is also correct. Points were deducted due to a logical error in the iterative argument (claiming Q(0)=0 instead of the correct Q(2)=0) and for omitting the final step of verifying that the found family of solutions satisfies the original equation.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical error in an intermediate step; omission of the final verification step."
