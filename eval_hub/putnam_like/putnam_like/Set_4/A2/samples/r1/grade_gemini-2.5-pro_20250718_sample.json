    "comment": "The student correctly identified the roots of the polynomial at x = 0, 2, 4, ..., 2022 and stated the correct final form of the solution. However, the solution lacks significant justification. The core iterative argument, worth 6 points, is only briefly summarized rather than demonstrated. Furthermore, the crucial step of proving that the final quotient polynomial must be a constant is asserted without any argument. The final verification step is also missing.",
