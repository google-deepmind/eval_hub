    "comment": "The solution is flawless and presents a clear, direct, and elegant proof. Although the method differs from the proof by contradiction outlined in the rubric, it is a standard and fully correct approach. The student correctly defines an element $r = ba^{-1}$, proves its order modulo $p$ is exactly $2^{k+1}$, and then correctly applies Lagrange's Theorem (a consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem) to show that $2^{k+1}$ must divide $p-1$. This directly leads to the desired conclusion. All steps are well-justified.",
