    "comment": "The student provides a flawless and elegant direct proof, which is a valid alternative to the proof-by-contradiction method outlined in the rubric. The solution correctly shows that p cannot divide a or b, simplifies the problem by considering the element x = ab^{-1}, and correctly deduces that the order of x modulo p is exactly 2^{k+1}. Applying Fermat's Little Theorem, the student correctly concludes that 2^{k+1} must divide p-1, which directly proves the required form of p. The entire argument is logical, well-structured, and complete.",
