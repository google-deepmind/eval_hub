    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It presents a concise and elegant direct proof by correctly determining the order of the element `a*b^(-1)` modulo `p`. The argument is logical, well-structured, and demonstrates a strong command of group theory concepts in number theory. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a fully valid and correct approach, earning full marks.",
