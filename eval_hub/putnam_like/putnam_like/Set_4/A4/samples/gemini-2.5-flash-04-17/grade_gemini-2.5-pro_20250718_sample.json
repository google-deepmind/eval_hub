Although the method used (based on the order of an element) is different from the one outlined in the rubric (proof by contradiction), it is a standard and equally valid approach. The reasoning is clear, logical, and every step is well-justified, leading to the correct conclusion. Full credit is awarded for a flawless solution.",
