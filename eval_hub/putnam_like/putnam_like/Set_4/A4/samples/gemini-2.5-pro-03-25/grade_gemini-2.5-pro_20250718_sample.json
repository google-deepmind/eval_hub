    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. While the method used (based on the order of an element) is different from the one outlined in the rubric (proof by contradiction), it is a standard and elegant approach to this type of problem. The argument is logically sound, well-structured, and all steps are correctly justified. The conclusion that the order of $ab^{-1} \\pmod p$ is $2^{k+1}$ is the key insight, which is correctly derived and used to show that $p-1$ must be divisible by $2^{k+1}.",
