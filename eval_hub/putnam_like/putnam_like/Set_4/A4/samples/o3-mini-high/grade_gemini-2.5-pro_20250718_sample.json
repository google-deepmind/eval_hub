    "comment": "The student provides a fully correct and elegant proof. By skillfully using the concept of multiplicative order, the student directly establishes that the order of `ab\u207b\u00b9` modulo `p` is `2^(k+1)`. The conclusion then follows directly from the property that the order of an element must divide `p-1`. Although this proof differs from the method outlined in the rubric, it is a more direct and standard approach, demonstrating a high level of understanding. Full marks are awarded for this flawless solution.",
