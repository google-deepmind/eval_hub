    "comment": "The student provides a complete and elegant proof. Although the method used (based on the multiplicative order of an element) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (proof by contradiction), it is a standard and perfectly valid approach to this type of problem. The argument is clear, concise, and logically flawless, leading directly to the desired conclusion. Full marks are awarded for this excellent solution.",
