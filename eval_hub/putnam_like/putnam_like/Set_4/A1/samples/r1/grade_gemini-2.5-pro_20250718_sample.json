    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct, though unconventional, solution. Instead of directly applying the L'H\u00f4pital's rule trick shown in the rubric, the student treats the expression as a linear first-order ODE, solves it using an integrating factor, and then applies L'H\u00f4pital's rule to the resulting form of f(x). This alternative method is mathematically sound, rigorous, and ultimately relies on the same core principles as the rubric's solution. The student successfully demonstrates all the key insights required to solve the problem.",
