It correctly identifies the key step of rewriting f(x) as a quotient involving e^g(x) and perfectly applies L'H\u00f4pital's rule as outlined in the rubric. The justification for the application of the rule is rigorous and complete. The inclusion of a second, alternative correct proof further highlights the student's mastery of the material.",
