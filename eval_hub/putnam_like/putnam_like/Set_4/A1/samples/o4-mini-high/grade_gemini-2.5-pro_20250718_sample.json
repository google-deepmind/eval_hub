    "comment": "The student provides a creative, alternative proof by integrating an auxiliary function, which differs from the direct L'H\u00f4pital's rule approach in the rubric. The initial setup with the function u(x) and its derivative is correct and shows good insight (2/10 points). The overall structure of the proof from first principles is ambitious. However, the core of the argument contains a critical flaw: the integral estimation step implicitly assumes that g(x) is eventually monotonic. This is not guaranteed by the problem's conditions (e.g., g(x)=x+2sin(x) is a counterexample). This unjustified step invalidates the remainder of the proof, earning partial credit for the substantive but incomplete attempt (4/8 points).",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap / Unjustified assumption. The proof's central inequality relies on the assumption that g(x) is eventually monotonic, a condition not guaranteed by the problem statement."
