    "comment": "The solution is excellent and provides a complete, rigorous proof. Although the method used (substitution followed by a first-principles argument with an auxiliary function) differs from the direct L'H\u00f4pital's rule application suggested in the rubric, it is mathematically sound and demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. The core idea of using an integrating factor (implicitly, $e^t$ after substitution, which corresponds to $e^{g(x)}$) is correctly identified and utilized to reach the final conclusion. Full credit is awarded for a correct and well-reasoned alternative solution.",
