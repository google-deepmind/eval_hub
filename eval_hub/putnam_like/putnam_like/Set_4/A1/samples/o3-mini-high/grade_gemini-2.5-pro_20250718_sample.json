    "comment": "The student correctly identified the auxiliary function $F(x) = e^{g(x)}f(x)$ (or the 'integrating factor') which is the crucial first step and equivalent to the setup in the rubric. However, the rest of the argument is incorrect. The solution incorrectly deduces that $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} F'(x) = 0$ (which is an indeterminate form of type '$\\infty \\cdot 0$') and then incorrectly concludes that $F(x)$ must converge to a constant because its derivative approaches zero. The correct approach, after setting up the expression, is to apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule to the fraction $\\frac{e^{g(x)}f(x)}{e^{g(x)}}$, which was not done.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Fallacy, Methodology Error. The solution contains invalid deductions about limits of indeterminate forms and incorrect implications of a derivative approaching zero. It fails to apply the required L'H\u00f4pital's rule."
