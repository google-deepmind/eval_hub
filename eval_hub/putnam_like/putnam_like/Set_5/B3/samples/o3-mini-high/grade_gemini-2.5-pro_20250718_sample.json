    "comment": "The solution makes several correct initial deductions, such as $f(0)=0$ and that $f(m)$ must be even for any odd integer $m$. However, the main argument used to prove non-existence is invalid. It relies on an unproven assumption in Step 4 (that a derived value $g(m)$ is odd) and then concludes with a logical fallacy in Step 6, where the failure of a linear ansatz is incorrectly presented as a general proof of non-existence. The solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric and does not constitute a valid proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The proof contains a major logical gap (unjustified assumption) and a logical fallacy (hasty generalization, where disproving a specific case is used to argue for the general case)."
