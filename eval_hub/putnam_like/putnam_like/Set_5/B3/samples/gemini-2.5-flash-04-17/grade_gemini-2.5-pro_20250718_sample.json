    "comment": "The student follows a valid alternative path by defining f(x)=2g(x) and deriving the functional equation 9g(x)-20g(g(x))=x. This part is excellent. The subsequent analysis correctly deduces the necessary condition 9g(x) \u2261 x (mod 20). However, the student struggles to find a contradiction from this point and their final argument relies on an unsubstantiated formula, which invalidates the conclusion. Partial credit is awarded for the significant correct progress made.",
