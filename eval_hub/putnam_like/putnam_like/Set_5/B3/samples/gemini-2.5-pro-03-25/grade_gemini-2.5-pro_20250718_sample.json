    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof that no such function exists. Although the method is different from the one outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and logically sound. The argument starts by analyzing the implications of the equations for specific values (f(1)), follows a detailed chain of deductions, and successfully arrives at a contradiction, showing that f(x) cannot be an integer for all x. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of the problem and good problem-solving skills.",
