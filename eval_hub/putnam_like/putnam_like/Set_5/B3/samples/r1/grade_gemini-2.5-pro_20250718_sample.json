    "comment": "The student correctly concludes that no such function exists and makes some correct preliminary deductions, such as f(x) \u2261 8x (mod 10). However, the solution does not follow any of the steps outlined in the grading rubric. The student's own argument is critically flawed, as it derives a complex equation and then asserts without any proof that it leads to a contradiction. In mathematics, asserting a conclusion is not sufficient; a rigorous proof is required. Since no part of the rubric's required steps were met and the student's own line of reasoning was incomplete, the solution earns only minimal credit for the correct answer.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary error is a major logical gap, where a contradiction is asserted without any justification or proof. The argument is incomplete. The solution also completely diverges from the method detailed in the grading rubric."
