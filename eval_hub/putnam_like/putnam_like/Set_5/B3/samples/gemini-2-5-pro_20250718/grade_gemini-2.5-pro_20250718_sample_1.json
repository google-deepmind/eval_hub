    "comment": "The solution is complete, correct, and very well-argued. While the method used is different from the one outlined in the provided rubric, it is equally valid and demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. The student successfully reduces the problem to a new functional equation on the odd integers, analyzes the resulting recurrence relation, and correctly derives a contradiction. The reasoning is flawless.",
