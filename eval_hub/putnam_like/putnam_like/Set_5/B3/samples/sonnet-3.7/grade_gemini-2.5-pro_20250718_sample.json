    "comment": "The student provides a fully correct proof by considering the case x=1 and deriving a contradiction between the two given conditions. This is a valid and successful method. However, the score is reduced because the student includes a second, alternative argument that contains a major logical fallacy: the incorrect assumption that any function satisfying f(2x)=2f(x) must be linear. This error demonstrates a significant conceptual misunderstanding.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Fallacy: The solution makes the false claim that a function satisfying f(2x)=2f(x) for all integers x must be of the form f(x)=kx. This invalidates the second half of the argument."
