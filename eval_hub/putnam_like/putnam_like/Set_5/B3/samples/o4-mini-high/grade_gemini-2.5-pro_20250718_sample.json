    "comment": "The student correctly proves that f(0)=0 using a valid infinite descent argument. This corresponds to proving a special case of the main argument in the rubric. However, the solution then makes a major logical leap by asserting without proof that f(x)=0 for all x. The final contradiction is derived from this unproven claim, and the more general and powerful argument outlined in the rubric is missed entirely.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Unsubstantiated claim / major logical gap. The solution correctly proves a result for the specific case x=0 but then incorrectly asserts that the result holds for all x without providing any justification."
