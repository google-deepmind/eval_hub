    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct, albeit unconventional, solution. The proof that the sequence $b_n = a_n/3^n$ is increasing is valid. The method for proving that $b_n$ is bounded above is substantially different from the intended solution but is mathematically rigorous and leads to a correct (and even tighter) bound for the limit. All steps are well-justified. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of sequences, series, and recurrence relations.",
