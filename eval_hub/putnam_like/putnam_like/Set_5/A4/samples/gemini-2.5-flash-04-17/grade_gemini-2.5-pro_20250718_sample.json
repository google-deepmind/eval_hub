    "comment": "The student presents a creative and largely correct solution. They successfully transform the recurrence and prove that the sequence $b_n = a_n/3^n$ is bounded above by $5/4$ (which is a stronger bound than the one suggested in the rubric) and thus less than $7/4$. The argument for the sequence being increasing has a gap, as it relies on the unproven fact that $a_n > 0$. The overall structure of the proof (showing the sequence is monotone and bounded) is sound.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap. The proof that the sequence is increasing relies on the fact that $a_n>0$, which was not proven. The rubric specifically awards a point for an inductive proof of this fact, which was omitted."
