    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the high-level strategy of proving the sequence $b_n=a_n/3^n$ is increasing and bounded above. However, the execution is severely flawed. The key proofs for both monotonicity (increasing) and the upper bound are either missing or logically incorrect. The argument for the upper bound relies on an auxiliary sequence whose properties are stated without justification, and the inductive step to relate $b_n$ to this sequence is fallacious. The solution lacks the necessary rigor for a mathematical proof.",
