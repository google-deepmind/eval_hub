    "comment": "The student correctly reformulates the problem in terms of the sequence b_n = a_n/3^n and provides a valid proof that this sequence is increasing. The conclusion that the limit exists and is bounded follows correctly from the Monotone Convergence Theorem. However, the solution critically fails to prove that the sequence (b_n) is bounded above by 7/4, which is the most significant part of the problem (worth 6/10 points). The student simply asserts this fact without providing the necessary derivation, which involves establishing an inequality and summing a series.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major omission / unsubstantiated claim. The proof of the upper bound for the sequence, a central and heavily weighted part of the problem, is completely missing and only asserted as true."
