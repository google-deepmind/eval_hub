    "comment": "The solution is flawless and elegant. The student introduces an original and effective method by analyzing the recurrence relation for the differences `b_{n+1}-b_n`. The proof that the sequence is increasing and bounded is clear and well-argued. All calculations, including the summation of the infinite series used for the bound, are correct. The final conclusion is stronger than required by the problem statement. An excellent submission.",
