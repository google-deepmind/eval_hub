    "comment": "The student correctly sets up an equivalent problem in terms of $b_n = a_n/3^n$ and successfully proves that this sequence is increasing. This shows the limit exists, provided the sequence is bounded. However, the student's attempt to prove the sequence is bounded above by 7/4 fails due to a critical logical flaw in their inductive proof. As the proof of boundedness is the most substantial part of the problem, the solution is largely incomplete.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical error in an inductive proof; Incomplete justification / hand-waving; Argument from numerical calculation."
