    "comment": "The solution is flawless and demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. The method of defining an intermediate sequence c_n is elegant and leads to a more direct derivation of the necessary bounds than the path suggested in the rubric. All steps are logically sound, clearly explained, and mathematically rigorous. The student correctly proves that the sequence b_n is increasing and bounded, calculates the bound correctly, and successfully proves the claim. The fact that the student derives a tighter bound (5/4) than required (7/4) is commendable. An exemplary solution.",
