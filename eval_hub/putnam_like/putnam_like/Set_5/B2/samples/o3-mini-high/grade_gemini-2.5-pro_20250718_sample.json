    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. The student follows a different but equally valid path compared to the one suggested in the rubric. The argument proceeds by finding an annihilating polynomial for matrix A, determining the possible eigenvalues for A, correctly discarding a case using the invertibility of B, and then deducing the eigenvalues of AB. All steps are logically sound and well-explained, leading to the correct final answer. The reasoning is clear and rigorous.",
