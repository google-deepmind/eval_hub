    "comment": "The solution is flawless and logically sound. The student correctly establishes that A and B commute. Although the student's method for finding the relationship for C=AB differs from the one outlined in the rubric (deriving C=2I directly instead of finding the annihilating polynomial 2C(C-2I)=0), it is a perfectly valid and even more direct approach. The final determinant is computed correctly based on this result. Full marks are awarded for a complete and correct solution.",
