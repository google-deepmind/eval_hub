    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem. Although the method used is different from the one outlined in the rubric, it is mathematically sound and rigorous. The student correctly derives a polynomial for matrix A, finds its possible eigenvalues, uses the given conditions to constrain them, and correctly deduces that all eigenvalues of AB must be 2, leading to the correct final answer. The reasoning is clear and well-executed.",
