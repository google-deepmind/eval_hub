    "comment": "The solution is flawless and receives full credit. The student follows a different but equally rigorous path compared to the one in the rubric. The argument correctly establishes that A and B commute, uses the given matrix equations to find an annihilating polynomial for A, and correctly uses the invertibility of both A and B to constrain the eigenvalues of A. This leads to the correct deduction that all eigenvalues of AB are 2, and therefore det(AB) = 2^n. Every step is logically sound and clearly explained.",
