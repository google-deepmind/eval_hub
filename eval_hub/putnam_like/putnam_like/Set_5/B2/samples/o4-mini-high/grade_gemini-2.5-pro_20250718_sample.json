    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and follows a clear, logical path. While the approach differs from the one suggested in the rubric (by finding an annihilating polynomial for A instead of for AB), it is a perfectly valid and arguably more direct method. The student correctly uses the invertibility of A and B to simplify the polynomial and correctly deduces that AB = 2I, from which the determinant is easily calculated. A flawless solution.",
