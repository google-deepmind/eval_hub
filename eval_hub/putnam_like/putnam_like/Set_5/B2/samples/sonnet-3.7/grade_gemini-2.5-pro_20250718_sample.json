    "comment": "The solution is flawless and provides a complete, correct proof. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric (by analyzing eigenvalues of A and B directly, rather than the matrix product C=AB), it is equally valid. All key logical steps\u2014establishing an annihilating polynomial, finding possible eigenvalues, and using the invertibility condition to eliminate possibilities\u2014are present and correctly executed, leading to the correct final answer.",
