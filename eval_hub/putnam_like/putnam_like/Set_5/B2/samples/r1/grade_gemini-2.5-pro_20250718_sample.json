    "comment": "The solution follows a valid alternative path and performs the algebraic manipulations correctly to arrive at the equation $(A-I)(A^2-A+2I)=0$. However, the subsequent step of concluding that $A^2-A+2I=0$ is not properly justified. The reasoning that 'As A is invertible, A != I' is insufficient to 'cancel' the $(A-I)$ factor. For matrices, the fact that a factor is not the zero matrix does not mean it is invertible. The correct justification requires proving that the matrix $(A-I)$ is invertible (which follows from B being invertible). This is a significant logical error in the core of the argument.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Reasoning Error: The solution incorrectly concludes from a matrix product $MN=0$ that if $M \neq 0$, then $N=0$. The correct condition required is that $M$ must be invertible. The proof that the factor $(A-I)$ is invertible is missing."
