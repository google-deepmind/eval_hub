    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly applies the Rational Root Theorem to determine the nature of any potential rational roots. The core of the argument, which uses modular arithmetic (mod 2) to derive a contradiction from the given information about P(-1), is sound and well-explained. The student's approach of relating P(1) and P(-1) is a valid and elegant way to complete the proof.",
