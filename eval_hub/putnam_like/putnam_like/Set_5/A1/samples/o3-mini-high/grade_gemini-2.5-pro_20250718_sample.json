    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly sets up a proof by contradiction, properly applies the Rational Root Theorem to deduce that any rational root p/q must have p and q as odd integers. The core of the argument, using modular arithmetic (mod 2) to link the properties of the coefficients to the assumption of a rational root, is executed perfectly and leads to the correct contradiction. The steps are well-explained and logically sound.",
