    "comment": "The solution is complete and logically correct. The student correctly applies the Rational Root Theorem to determine that any potential rational root p/q must have odd p and q. The core of the proof correctly uses modular arithmetic (mod 2) to show that the assumption of a rational root leads to the sum of coefficients being even, while the condition that P(-1) is odd implies the sum of coefficients is odd. This is a clear contradiction, and the argument is well-reasoned and sound.",
