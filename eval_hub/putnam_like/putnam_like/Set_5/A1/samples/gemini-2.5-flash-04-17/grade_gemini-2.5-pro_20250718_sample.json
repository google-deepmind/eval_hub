    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly applies the Rational Root Theorem to determine that any potential rational root p/q must have p and q as odd integers. The core of the argument, which involves considering the polynomial equation modulo 2, is executed perfectly. The student correctly deduces from P(-1) being odd that the sum of coefficients must be odd, and from P(p/q)=0 that the sum of coefficients must be even. This contradiction is clearly stated and correctly proves the claim.",
