    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly uses the Rational Root Theorem to establish the properties of any potential rational root p/q, specifically that both p and q must be odd. The argument then proceeds by contradiction using parity. The proof provided is detailed, logically sound, and well-explained, successfully demonstrating that the existence of a rational root would contradict the given information. The student's path is slightly different from the provided rubric's, but it is equally valid and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem.",
