    "comment": "The solution is complete and logically correct. It correctly applies the Rational Root Theorem to determine the form of any potential rational root. The core of the argument, which uses modular arithmetic to derive a contradiction from the problem's conditions, is sound. The student successfully demonstrates that if a rational root existed, the sum of the coefficients $\\sum a_i$ would be even, while the condition on $P(-1)$ implies $\\sum a_i$ must be odd, leading to the required contradiction. The argument is well-structured and easy to follow.",
