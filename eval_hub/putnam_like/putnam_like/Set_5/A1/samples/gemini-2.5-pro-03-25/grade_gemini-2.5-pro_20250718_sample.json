    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly applies the Rational Root Theorem to determine that any potential rational root p/q must have an odd numerator and an odd denominator. The core of the argument, a proof by contradiction using modular arithmetic (modulo 2), is executed flawlessly. The student clearly demonstrates that the existence of a rational root would require the sum of coefficients to be even, while the given condition that P(-1) is odd implies the sum of coefficients must be odd, leading to a clear contradiction. The reasoning is sound and well-structured.",
