Solution step (1 point):
 Suppose the rational $\frac pq$ is a root of $P(x)$. Then
$0=q^n P\left(\frac pq\right)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_kp^kq^{n-k}=a_0q^n +a_np^n+pq\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_kp^{k-1}q^{n-k-1}.$

Solution step (1 point):
Therefore $p|a_0$ and $q|a_n$, so $p$ is a power of $3$ and $q$ is a power of $5$. In particular, both are odd numbers.

Solution step (8 points):
Note that, modulo 2, 
$$1\equiv_2 P(-1)=\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k a_k\equiv_2 \sum_{k=0}^n a_k \equiv_2 \sum_{k=0}^n a_k p^k q^{n-k}=P\left(\frac pq\right)=0,$$
a contradiction.
