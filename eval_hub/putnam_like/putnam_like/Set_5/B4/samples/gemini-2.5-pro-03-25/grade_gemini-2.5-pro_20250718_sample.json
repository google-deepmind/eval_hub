    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. They cleverly deduce that any cube in the ring has an additive order of at most 2. This insight allows for an elegant argument that the set of cubes is closed under subtraction, which is a key step. Both cases, a=b and a!=b, are handled correctly with sound algebraic manipulation and clear reasoning. The solution is flawless, even though it follows a slightly different logical path than the one outlined in the rubric.",
