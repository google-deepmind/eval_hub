    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. The student correctly handles both the a=b and a!=b cases. For the a!=b case, the student cleverly rewrites the expression (a+b)^3 - c^3 as a sum of two cubes, (a+b)^3 + (-c)^3, which allows for a direct application of the first property. This is a valid and elegant argument that bypasses the need to prove that the set of cubes is closed under subtraction, as suggested in the rubric.",
