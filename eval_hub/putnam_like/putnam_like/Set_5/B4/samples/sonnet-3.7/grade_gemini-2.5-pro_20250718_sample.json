    "comment": "The solution is complete and mathematically sound. It correctly handles both cases, $a=b$ and $a \\neq b$. For the case $a \\neq b$, the student correctly expands $(a+b)^3$, simplifies the expression using the given properties, and correctly argues that the resulting expression is a cube. The method used to show that a difference of cubes is a cube is a direct and valid application of Property 1, even though it differs from the approach suggested in the rubric.",
