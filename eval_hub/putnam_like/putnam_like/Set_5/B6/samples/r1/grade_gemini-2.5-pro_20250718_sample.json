    "comment": "The student presents a correct and elegant alternative proof using a probabilistic coupling argument, which is a valid approach. The overall logical structure is sound. However, the solution lacks rigor and key details expected at this level. Specifically, it fails to formally show why the function f(t) represents the stated probability, and it omits the construction of the coupling, which is central to the argument. For these reasons, points were deducted.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete justification: The solution presents correct claims but omits key derivations, making it more of a proof sketch than a complete argument. The connection between the given function and the probabilistic model is asserted but not proven, and the coupling mechanism is not constructed."
