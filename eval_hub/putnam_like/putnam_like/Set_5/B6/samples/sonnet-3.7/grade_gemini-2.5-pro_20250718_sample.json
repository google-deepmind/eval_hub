    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof using a probabilistic coupling argument. This method is different from the geometric approach in the rubric, but it is a valid and elegant alternative. The probabilistic interpretation of the function is correctly established, the coupling construction is sound, and the final deduction from the property of the family F is logical and well-explained. The solution demonstrates a full understanding of the problem and deserves full credit.",
