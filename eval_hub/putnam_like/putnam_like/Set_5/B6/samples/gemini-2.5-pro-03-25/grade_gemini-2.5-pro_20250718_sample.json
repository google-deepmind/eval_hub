    "comment": "The student provides a correct and elegant probabilistic proof. While the method differs from the geometric approach outlined in the rubric, it is conceptually equivalent and demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem. The interpretation of the function as a probability and the use of a coupling argument to show monotonicity are perfectly analogous to the rubric's steps involving volume and set inclusion. The reasoning is clear, concise, and flawless. The alternative proof using calculus is also correct and further demonstrates the student's mastery.",
