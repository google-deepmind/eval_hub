    "comment": "The student provides two complete and flawless proofs. While neither proof strictly follows the exact steps outlined in the rubric's geometric argument (e.g., by defining g(t)=f(1-t)), the student's second proof using a probabilistic coupling argument is conceptually identical and equally rigorous. The first proof using calculus is also a well-known and perfectly executed alternative. The solution demonstrates a full mastery of the problem and relevant techniques. A perfect score is warranted.",
