    "comment": "The solution provides a completely correct and elegant proof using a probabilistic coupling argument. It correctly re-interprets the function f(t) as the probability of an event, and then shows that this event is more likely for smaller t due to the downward-closed nature of the family F. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric (which uses a geometric volume argument), it is a standard and valid approach for this type of problem and demonstrates a full understanding. The solution is well-written and flawless.",
