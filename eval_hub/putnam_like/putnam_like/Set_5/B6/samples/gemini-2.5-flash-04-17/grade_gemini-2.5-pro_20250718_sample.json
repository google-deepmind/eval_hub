    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant proof using a probabilistic coupling argument. However, the provided grading rubric outlines a very specific geometric proof strategy. The student's solution does not follow the prescribed method (e.g., it does not define g(t)=f(1-t), nor does it interpret the sum in terms of volumes of hyperrectangles). As the student's work does not contain the steps required by the rubric, no points can be awarded based on the given grading scheme. The solution itself is mathematically flawless.",
