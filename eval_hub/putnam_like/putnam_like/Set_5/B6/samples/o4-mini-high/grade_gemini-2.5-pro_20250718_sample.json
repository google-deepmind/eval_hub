    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant probabilistic proof. While this approach differs from the geometric interpretation outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and well-known method for solving this problem. The key steps of re-interpreting the function f(t) as a probability and then using the properties of this probabilistic construction to show the non-increasing nature of the function are executed flawlessly. As the problem statement does not mandate a specific method, this alternative correct solution deserves full credit.",
