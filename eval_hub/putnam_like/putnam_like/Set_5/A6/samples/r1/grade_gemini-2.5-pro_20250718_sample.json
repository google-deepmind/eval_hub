    "comment": "The solution correctly sets up the problem by parameterizing the points and finding the intersection of the tangents. However, it then unjustifiably restricts the problem to a symmetric case, missing the main geometric argument required for a full proof (worth 7 points). The calculation of the circumradius for this specific case is correct, but a final error in evaluating the limit leads to the wrong numerical answer. Partial credit is awarded for correctly identifying and analyzing the limiting symmetric case, despite the final error.",
