    "comment": "The student presents a complete and rigorous analytical solution. While the method differs from the geometric approach in the rubric, it is entirely valid and executed without error. The student correctly calculates the coordinates of the intersection point R, derives a complicated but accurate formula for the circumradius, and then successfully finds its infimum through a series of clever substitutions and calculus. The reasoning is sound and the calculations are flawless.",
