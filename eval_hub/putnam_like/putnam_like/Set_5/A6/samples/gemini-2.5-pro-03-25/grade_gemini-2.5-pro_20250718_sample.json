    "comment": "The student presents a valid alternative solution path using coordinate geometry. The derivation of the coordinates of R and the final expression for the circumradius are impressively carried out and correct. The argument that the infimum is $\\sqrt{2}/2$ because it is approached as P and Q tend to (1,1) is also correct. However, the proof that $\\sqrt{2}/2$ is a global lower bound is incomplete; the key inequality is only verified for special cases ($p=1$ and $q=1/p$) and not proven in general. This logical gap prevents a perfect score.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Proof / Logical Gap. The solution claims a general inequality holds after only verifying it for specific, non-exhaustive cases."
