    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. While it follows a purely analytical path instead of the geometric approach suggested in the rubric, it is entirely valid and rigorous. The student successfully derives the correct, albeit complex, formula for the circumradius of triangle PQR. Remarkably, this formula is identical to the circumradius of triangle OPQ, thus implicitly achieving the main insight of the rubric's first part. The subsequent minimization of this formula is executed flawlessly, including a rigorous justification for considering the symmetric case (pq=1) and correctly finding the limit as the points converge. The final answer is correct and well-supported.",
