    "comment": "The student presents a complete and valid analytical solution, which is a correct alternative to the geometric approach suggested in the rubric. The initial setup, the derivation of the intersection point R, and the final expression for the circumradius are all correct and demonstrate strong algebraic skills. The strategy of finding the infimum by minimizing the limiting radius (the radius of curvature) is also sound. The final answer is correct. However, there is a significant calculation error when differentiating the limiting radius function. The polynomial equation derived, `3a^12 + a^8 - 3a^4 - 1 = 0`, is incorrect, although it coincidentally yields the correct location for the minimum at a=1. This error warrants a 2-point deduction from an otherwise perfect solution.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Calculation error: The derivative of the limiting radius function was computed incorrectly. The resulting polynomial equation for the critical points is wrong, though it happens to lead to the correct minimizer."
