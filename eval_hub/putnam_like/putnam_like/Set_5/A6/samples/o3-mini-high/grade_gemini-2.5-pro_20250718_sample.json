    "comment": "The student presents a well-written solution with significant correct calculations. The coordinates of the intersection point R are found correctly, and the calculation of the minimum radius of curvature is flawless. However, the solution is based on the critical and incorrect assumption that the infimum of the circumradius r(P,Q) is equal to the minimum radius of curvature. This conceptual error invalidates the overall argument and leads to an incorrect final answer of \u221a2 instead of the correct \u221a2/2. Limited credit is awarded for the correct preliminary calculations and for identifying that the extremum occurs in the limit as P and Q approach the point (1,1), which aligns with the spirit of the rubric's final step.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual error: The solution incorrectly assumes that the infimum of a function of two variables is achieved at the minimum of its limiting value as the variables coalesce. This leads to solving the wrong optimization problem (minimizing radius of curvature instead of the circumradius of \u0394OPQ)."
