    "comment": "The student uses a direct analytical approach instead of the intended geometric one. While the final answer is correct and the calculus for minimizing the limiting radius is flawless (corresponding to the last 3 points of the rubric), the solution has two major weaknesses. First, a complex formula for the circumradius is presented without derivation. Second, and more critically, it is asserted without proof that the infimum of the two-variable function $r(p,q)$ can be found by minimizing the one-variable limit $\\lim_{q\\to p} r(p,q)$. This is a significant logical gap, as it bypasses the main difficulty of the problem, which is handled by the geometric argument in the rubric's solution (worth 7 points). The setup and final minimization are correct, but the central argument is incomplete.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Gap: The solution relies on the unproven assumption that the infimum is the minimum of the radius of curvature (the limit as the two points approach each other). Incomplete Proof: A key intermediate result (the formula for the radius) is stated without derivation."
