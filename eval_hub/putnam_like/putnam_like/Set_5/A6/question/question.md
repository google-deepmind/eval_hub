There are two points $P,Q$, $P\neq Q$, on the positive branch of hyperbola
$$
\mathcal{H}=\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\,:\, y=\frac 1x,\, x>0,\,y>0\right\}.
$$
The line $k$ is a tangent at $P$, and the line $l$ is a tangent at $Q$, and the point $R$ is the intersection of $k$ and $l$. Denote by $r(P,Q)$ the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle $PQR$. Compute
$$
\inf_{P,Q}\, r(P,Q).
