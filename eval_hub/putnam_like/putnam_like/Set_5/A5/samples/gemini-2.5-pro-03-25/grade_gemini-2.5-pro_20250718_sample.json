    "comment": "The solution is flawless and exceptionally well-argued. The student first rigorously proves that the search for a minimizer can be restricted to non-positive functions. This key insight simplifies the problem significantly. The subsequent steps to identify the minimizer and calculate the minimum value are logical and executed without error. The argument presented provides a constructive proof for the existence of the minimum, which is more direct and elegant than the path suggested by the rubric.",
