    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the candidate minimizer u*(t) = -1-t^3 and correctly calculates the minimum value J(u*) = -549/140. The verification that u* belongs to the set F is also performed correctly. However, the solution fails to provide a rigorous proof that this is indeed the minimum value. The core of the argument, which involves establishing a general bound |u(t)| \u2264 t^3+1 for any function u in F (worth 7 points in the rubric), is missing. The student's argument relies on assuming the constraint is an equality, which is a plausible heuristic but not a complete proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Gap / Incomplete Proof. The solution does not prove that the identified candidate function is the global minimizer over the set F; it asserts this based on a non-rigorous argument instead of deriving the necessary bounds for all functions in the set."
