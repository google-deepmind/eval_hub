    "comment": "The solution is excellent. All steps are logically sound, well-explained, and mathematically correct. The derivation of the bound on |u(t)| matches the rubric's result. The candidate minimizer is correctly identified and verified to be in the set F. The proof of minimality, using a pointwise analysis of the integrand, is particularly rigorous and elegant. The final calculation of the minimum value is flawless. The solution demonstrates a complete and deep understanding of the problem.",
