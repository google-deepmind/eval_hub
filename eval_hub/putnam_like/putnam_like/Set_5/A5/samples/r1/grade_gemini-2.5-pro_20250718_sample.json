    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the candidate minimizer and the minimum value of the functional. However, it fails to provide the necessary justification required for a proof. The crucial steps of deriving the universal bound |u(t)| \u2264 t^3+1 and using it to bound the functional J(u) are absent. Furthermore, the verification that the proposed minimizer belongs to the family F is asserted but not shown. The alternative existence proof is sketched but not rigorously detailed.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Missing Justification / Incomplete Proof: Major claims are stated without derivation or verification, such as the bound on |u(t)|, the identity of the minimizer, and its membership in the family F."
