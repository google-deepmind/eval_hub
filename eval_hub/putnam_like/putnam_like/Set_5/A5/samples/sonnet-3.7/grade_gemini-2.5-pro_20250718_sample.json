    "comment": "The student's approach of minimizing the integrand pointwise is fundamentally flawed for this problem, as it fails to properly use the integral constraint that defines the set $F$. This leads to an incorrect candidate function and the wrong minimum value. The only credit awarded is for correctly demonstrating the procedure of verifying that a function belongs to the set $F$, which corresponds to the skill required in the final step of the rubric, even though it was applied to the wrong function.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual Error: The solution incorrectly assumes that the minimum of an integral functional is achieved by minimizing the integrand pointwise. This ignores the problem's specific constraints and represents a major logical flaw in the context of calculus of variations."
