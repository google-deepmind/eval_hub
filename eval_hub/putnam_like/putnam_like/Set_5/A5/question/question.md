 
 Let $F$ be the family of all continuous functions $u:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying 
 \[
 |u(t)|^2\leq 1+6\int_0^t s^2|u(s)|\, ds,\quad \forall t\in[0,1].
 \]
 The functional $J:F\to\mathbb{R}$ is defined by
 \[
 J(u)=\int_0^1 (u^3(t)-u^2(t))\,dt.
 \]
 Prove that $J$ attains a minimum value on $F$ and find it.
