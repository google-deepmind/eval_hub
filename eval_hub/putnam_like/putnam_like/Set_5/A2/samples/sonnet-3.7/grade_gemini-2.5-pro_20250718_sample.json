    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method (direct manipulation of sums) is different from the one outlined in the rubric (generating functions), it is equally valid and rigorous. The justification for the convergence of the series is stated, and the algebraic manipulations are flawless, leading to the correct result. Therefore, full credit is awarded.",
