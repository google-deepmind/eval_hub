The chosen method, based on analyzing the partial sums and their telescoping nature, is different from the generating function approach suggested by the rubric but is perfectly valid. All steps, from establishing the convergence properties of the sequences to the final calculation of the limit, are correct and well-justified. The solution is flawless.",
