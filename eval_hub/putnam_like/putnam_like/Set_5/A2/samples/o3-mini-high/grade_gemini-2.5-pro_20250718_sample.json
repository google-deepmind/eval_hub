    "comment": "The solution is entirely correct and provides a rigorous proof. The argument, which relies on summation by parts (or telescoping sums), is elegant and well-executed. Although it differs from the expected power series method outlined in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and complete approach to the problem, demonstrating a strong understanding of series manipulation. All steps are logically sound and clearly explained.",
