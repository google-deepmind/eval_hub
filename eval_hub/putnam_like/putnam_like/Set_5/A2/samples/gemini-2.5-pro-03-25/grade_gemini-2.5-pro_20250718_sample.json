    "comment": "The student provides a complete and fully rigorous proof. Although the method (summation by parts / analysis of partial sums) is different from the generating function approach outlined in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and well-executed alternative. The student first correctly proves the absolute convergence of the series, which justifies the subsequent manipulations. The calculation of the sum using partial sums is flawless, including the analysis of the remainder term. Full credit is awarded for a correct and well-reasoned solution.",
