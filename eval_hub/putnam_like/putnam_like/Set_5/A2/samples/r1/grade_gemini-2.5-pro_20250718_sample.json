    "comment": "The student presents a correct and elegant alternative solution by rearranging the series and calculating the coefficients of each $a_n$. The algebraic steps are flawless. However, the solution is docked one point for a lack of rigor. The rearrangement of an infinite series requires justification, which in this case is the absolute convergence of the series. The student failed to prove absolute convergence and did not use the given condition $a_{n+1} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} a_n$, which is essential for that proof. This corresponds to missing the first step in the provided rubric.",
