    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It presents a correct and complete alternative approach to the one suggested in the rubric. The method of direct manipulation of partial sums (a telescoping sum argument) is executed perfectly. The key steps, including re-indexing the sums, identifying the cancellation of interior terms, and correctly calculating the boundary terms and their limits, are all present and well-justified.",
