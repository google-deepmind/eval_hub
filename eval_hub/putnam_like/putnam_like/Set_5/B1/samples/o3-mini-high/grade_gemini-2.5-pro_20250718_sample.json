    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and valid proof using mathematical induction and H\u00f6lder's inequality. This is an excellent alternative to the solution outlined in the rubric. However, the grading scheme allocates specific points for preliminary steps (handling the zero case and normalizing the inequality) which were not present in the student's solution, as their chosen method did not require them. Full credit is awarded for the main logical argument, which is the core of the problem and was executed flawlessly.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation from rubric; omission of a corner case. The provided proof is mathematically sound but does not follow the specific steps (normalization, AM-GM) outlined in the grading scheme. It also omits the explicit handling of the case where one of the sums a_i+b_i+c_i is zero."
