    "comment": "The solution provides a clear and correct proof for the main case where all sums $a_i+b_i+c_i$ are positive. The core argument, involving normalization and a clever application of the AM-GM inequality, is perfectly executed. The deduction of 1 point is for failing to address the trivial but necessary case where one or more of the sums $a_i+b_i+c_i$ are zero.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a corner case: The proof assumes division by $a_i+b_i+c_i$ is always possible, failing to address the case where this sum is zero for some $i$."
