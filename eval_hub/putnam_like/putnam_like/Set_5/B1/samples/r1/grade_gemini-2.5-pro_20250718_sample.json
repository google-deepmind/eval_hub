    "comment": "The solution is elegant and well-structured. The main argument, which involves normalizing the variables and applying the AM-GM inequality (presented here via Jensen's inequality on the logarithm, which is equivalent), is perfectly executed and earns full marks for those steps. However, the solution omits the initial case where one of the denominators $a_i+b_i+c_i$ could be zero. The rubric explicitly allocates one point for handling this edge case, which was missed.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete argument / missing edge case: The proof implicitly assumes that $a_i+b_i+c_i > 0$ for all $i$ by performing division, without first addressing the case where some $a_i+b_i+c_i = 0$."
