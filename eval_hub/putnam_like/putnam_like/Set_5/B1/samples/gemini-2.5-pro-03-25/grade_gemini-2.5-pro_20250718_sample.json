    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly identifies and handles the edge case where a sum a_i+b_i+c_i is zero. For the main case, it correctly normalizes the inequality and then applies the AM-GM inequality to each term. The final summation step is also executed perfectly. The argument is clear, well-structured, and complete.",
