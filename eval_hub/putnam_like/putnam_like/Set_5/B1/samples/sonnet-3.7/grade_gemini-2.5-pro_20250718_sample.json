    "comment": "The student provides a very clear and well-structured proof. The use of substitution to normalize the inequality is elegant. The application of the AM-GM inequality and the subsequent summation to reach the final result are flawless. A single point was deducted for not addressing the trivial edge case where one of the sums $a_i+b_i+c_i$ is zero, which is a required step according to the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of edge case: The solution implicitly assumes $a_i+b_i+c_i > 0$ for all $i$ in order to define the new variables, but fails to consider the case where some of these sums are zero."
