    "comment": "The solution is flawless and meticulously detailed. It correctly addresses the trivial case where the right-hand side is zero, then proceeds to normalize the inequality. The core of the proof, a skillful application of the AM-GM inequality to each of the three terms, is executed perfectly. The final step of summing the resulting inequalities is also correct. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.",
