    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the contour and the overall method (Argument Principle). The calculation of the change in argument along the real and imaginary axes is correct. However, the solution has several significant gaps. It fails to check for zeros on the boundary of the region, a necessary step. The justification for the change in argument on the circular arc lacks rigor, relying on an approximation without formal justification. The final conclusion that the change is exactly 4\u03c0 is also stated without sufficient reasoning.",
