    "comment": "The student uses Rouch\u00e9's Theorem, which is a valid approach for this type of problem, but the solution does not follow the argument principle method outlined in the rubric. The application of Rouch\u00e9's theorem is critically flawed: the condition |f(z)| > |g(z)| is only checked on the circular arc and fails on the axes, and the chosen function f(z) has a zero on the boundary of the region. Although the final answer is correct, it is not supported by a valid mathematical argument. A small amount of partial credit is given for correctly identifying the dominant term of the polynomial on a large arc, as this is a key insight that is also used in the argument principle method.",
