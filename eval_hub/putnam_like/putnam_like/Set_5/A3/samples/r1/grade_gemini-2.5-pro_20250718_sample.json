    "comment": "The student outlines a correct overall strategy for the proof, which is a valid alternative to the one in the rubric. They correctly identify that the problem can be solved by first evaluating the product $\\prod_{j \\neq i} (e_i + e_j)$ for each $i$ and then combining the results. However, there are two major errors in the execution. First, the justification for the key result $\\prod_{j \\neq i} (e_i + e_j) = 1/e_i$ is incorrect; the student confuses a polynomial with its evaluation related to a derivative. Second, the argument connecting the double product $\\prod_{i \\neq j}(e_i + e_j)$ to the final squared product $\\prod_{i<j}(e_i + e_j)^2$ is confused and invalid. These significant gaps in reasoning mean the solution is not a valid proof.",
