    "comment": "The solution is entirely correct and provides a complete, rigorous proof. The student uses a different but equally valid (and very elegant) method compared to the one outlined in the rubric. All key logical steps are present: deriving the identity $\\prod_{j \\neq i} (e_i+e_j) = 1/e_i$ for each root $e_i$, showing that the product of all roots is 1, and correctly combining these results to arrive at the final answer. Full marks are awarded for this excellent solution.",
