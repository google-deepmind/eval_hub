    "comment": "The student presents an alternative approach to the problem, which is creative. The derivation that $\\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(1+\\zeta^j) = 1$ is correct and shows good understanding of polynomials and roots of unity. This corresponds to the first 3 points of the rubric. However, the main argument contains critical flaws. The calculation of the exponent of $\\zeta$ in the first main factor is incorrect, and more significantly, the argument relies on the claim that $\\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2} k^2$ is a multiple of $n$ (i.e. that $n^2-1$ is divisible by 24), which is not true for all odd $n$ (e.g., when $n$ is a multiple of 3). This invalidates the core of the proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution contains a computational error in evaluating a sum and a major logical error based on a false number-theoretic claim, which makes the proof invalid."
