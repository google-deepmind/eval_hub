    "grade": 2,
    "comment": "The solution follows a completely different approach than the one outlined in the rubric. While credit is given for correctly proving a key intermediate identity analogous to the result in Step 2 of the rubric, the main argument of the proof is not present. Furthermore, the student's alternative approach contains a significant logical error by incorrectly assuming a product of complex numbers has a magnitude of 1. The final result is only reached due to this error and a subsequent calculation mistake.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Flaw: The argument incorrectly assumes a product of complex numbers of the form (1+z) has unit modulus. Calculation Error: An error was made when simplifying the expression for the final exponent. Deviation from Rubric: The solution's method does not align with the provided grading scheme."
