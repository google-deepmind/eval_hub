    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It presents a clear, logical, and fully correct proof. The method used, which involves the identity $z^n+1 = \\prod_{k=1}^n (z+e_k)$ and its evaluation at the roots of unity, is elegant and efficient. All steps are well-justified, including the calculation of the product of all roots of unity, which is shown in two different ways. The argument is complete and flawless.",
