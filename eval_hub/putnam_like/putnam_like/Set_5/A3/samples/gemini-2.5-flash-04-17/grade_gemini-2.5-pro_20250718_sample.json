    "comment": "The student presents a complete and elegant solution that is different from the one outlined in the rubric. The overall logic is sound and demonstrates a full understanding of the required concepts. A minor algebraic mistake was made when deriving the key identity for the polynomial R(x), where a sign was flipped. However, the correct identity was used for the remainder of the proof, so the error did not propagate. This single mistake warrants a small deduction.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Minor algebraic error: A sign error was made in an intermediate step of a derivation (equating P(-x) with the product form), though the final formula used was correct."
