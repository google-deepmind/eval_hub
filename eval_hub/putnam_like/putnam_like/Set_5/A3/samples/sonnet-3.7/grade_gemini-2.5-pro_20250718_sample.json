    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. The student employs an elegant and valid alternative method by defining a product S = \u220f_{i,j} (e_i+e_j) and evaluating it in two different ways. All steps are logically sound and well-explained, leading directly to the desired conclusion. This approach successfully demonstrates all the key mathematical concepts required to solve the problem, and is a perfectly acceptable alternative to the path outlined in the rubric.",
