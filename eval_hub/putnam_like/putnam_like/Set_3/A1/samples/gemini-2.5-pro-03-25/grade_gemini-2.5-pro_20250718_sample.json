    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly simplifies the expression for a_n, defines an appropriate continuous function, and analyzes its properties to prove the claim. The use of the derivative of the logarithm is a standard and well-executed technique. The argument that the first derivative is positive based on the sign of the second derivative and the limit at infinity is both elegant and correct. The work is clear, logical, and without any mathematical errors.",
