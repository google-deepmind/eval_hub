    "comment": "The simplification of the sequence term a_n is correct. The student identifies a valid proof strategy by analyzing the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n. However, the core of the proof is incomplete. After correctly identifying that the ratio is a product of terms greater than one and less than one, the solution merely asserts that the increasing factors 'dominate' without any rigorous mathematical justification. This is a critical logical gap, as it replaces the main analytical task with an unsubstantiated claim.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Gap / Unproven Claim. The central part of the proof relies on an assertion that is not mathematically demonstrated."
