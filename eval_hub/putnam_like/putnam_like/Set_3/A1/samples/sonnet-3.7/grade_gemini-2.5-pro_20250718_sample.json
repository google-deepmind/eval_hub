    "comment": "The student correctly simplifies the expression for a_n. A valid alternative proof strategy (analyzing the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n) is initiated and the ratio is correctly formulated. However, the solution stops there, failing to provide the rigorous argument needed to prove the ratio is greater than 1. Instead, it relies on checking the first few terms, which does not constitute a valid proof. The conclusion is therefore unsupported by a formal argument.",
