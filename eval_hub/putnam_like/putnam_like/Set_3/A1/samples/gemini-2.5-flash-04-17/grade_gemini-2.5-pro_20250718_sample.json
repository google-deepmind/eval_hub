    "comment": "The student correctly simplifies the expression for a_n and identifies the correct strategy of analyzing the sign of the derivative of ln(a_n). The derivative is calculated correctly. However, the chosen method to prove the derivative is positive (Taylor series expansion) is not executed rigorously. The solution contains several calculation errors in the series coefficients and makes a logically flawed argument by assuming that the asymptotic behavior of the series determines its sign for all t >= 2. Credit is given for the correct setup, the derivative, and for correctly verifying the case n=1.",
