    "comment": "Simplification of the ratio $a_{n+1}/a_n$ is omitted in the solution. The study of $f(x)>0$ by Taylor expansion is a huge mistake - it could provide only the estimation for large n (but the precise explanation needs to be provided and one can not use bog O notation). The usage of log function is a good idea.",
