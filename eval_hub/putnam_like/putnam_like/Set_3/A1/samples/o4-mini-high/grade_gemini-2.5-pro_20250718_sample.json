    "comment": "The student correctly simplifies the expression for a_n and sets up a valid overall strategy by analyzing the logarithm of the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n. However, the core of the proof contains several major errors. The formula derived for the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n is incorrect. Furthermore, the subsequent asymptotic analysis is flawed due to multiple errors in the Taylor expansions and an incorrect combination of the resulting terms. While the initial setup and final conclusion are correct, the central argument fails due to these cascading calculation mistakes.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major algebraic error in deriving the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n. Multiple calculation errors in Taylor series expansions. Incorrect simplification of asymptotic terms."
