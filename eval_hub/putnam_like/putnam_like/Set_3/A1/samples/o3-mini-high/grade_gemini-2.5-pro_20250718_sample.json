    "comment": "The student correctly simplifies the expression for `a_n` and successfully reformulates the problem as proving the inequality `a_{n+1}/a_n > 1`. The algebraic manipulation to arrive at the expression for this ratio is correct. However, the crucial step of actually proving this inequality is omitted; the solution simply asserts that it can be proven. This significant gap in the argument is why full credit cannot be awarded.",
