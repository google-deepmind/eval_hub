    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly simplifies the expression for the sequence term. The use of logarithmic differentiation is appropriate. The proof that the derivative is positive is rigorous and mathematically sound, leading to the correct conclusion. Although the method for proving the derivative's positivity differs from the rubric's suggested path (using an inequality instead of the second derivative), it is a valid and elegant alternative.",
