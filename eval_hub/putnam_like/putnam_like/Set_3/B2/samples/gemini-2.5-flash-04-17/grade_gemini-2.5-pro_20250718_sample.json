    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution using an alternative, valid method based on asymptotic expansions. The inner sum is correctly identified as a geometric series, and its asymptotic behavior for large k is meticulously derived using Taylor series. The resulting terms are summed correctly, and the final limit is calculated accurately. Although the method differs from the Riemann sum approach in the rubric, it is equally valid and demonstrates a high level of mathematical proficiency. Therefore, full credit is awarded.",
