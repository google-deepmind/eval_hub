    "comment": "The student provides a correct final answer using an alternative method to the one in the rubric. The solution correctly identifies that the expression involves nested Riemann sums, corresponding to the integrals of e^x and x, and evaluates these correctly. However, the core argument contains a significant logical flaw: it informally replaces the inner sum with its limit value (e-1) inside the outer sum. This step, replacing a term dependent on the summation index k with its limit as k\u2192\u221e, lacks rigorous justification and is not generally valid. Points were awarded for correctly identifying the integral components and performing the calculations, but points were deducted for the non-rigorous justification.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of rigor / Invalid justification. The solution uses an unjustified approximation by interchanging a limit and a sum, replacing a term inside a summation with its limiting value."
