Although the methods used (Stolz-Ces\u00e0ro theorem and asymptotic expansion) differ from the Riemann sum approach outlined in the rubric, they are valid, advanced, and flawlessly executed alternative solutions that merit full credit. The submission demonstrates an excellent command of the relevant mathematical concepts.",
