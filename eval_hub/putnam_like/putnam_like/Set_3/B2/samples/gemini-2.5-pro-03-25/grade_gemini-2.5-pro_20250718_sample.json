    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant solution. The inner sum is correctly identified and summed as a geometric series. The main argument correctly applies the Stolz-Cesaro theorem to evaluate the limit of the sequence of sums. The final limit calculation is flawless. Although the method differs from the Riemann sum approach in the rubric, it is a valid and rigorous alternative, deserving of full credit.",
