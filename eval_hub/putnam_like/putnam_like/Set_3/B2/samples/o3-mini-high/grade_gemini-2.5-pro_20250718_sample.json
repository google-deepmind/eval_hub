    "comment": "The student arrived at the correct final answer. The key insight of identifying the inner sum as a Riemann sum converging to (e-1) is correct. However, the solution contains a significant logical error: it assumes that because the term `(1/k) * sum(e^(l/k))` converges to `(e-1)`, it can be replaced by `(e-1)` inside the main summation over `k`. This interchange of a limit and a summation is not justified and makes the argument non-rigorous. The solution does not follow the intended method of interpreting the expression as a double Riemann integral, for which most of the points in the rubric are awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of Rigor / Invalid Justification. Specifically, interchanging a limit and a summation without justification (approximating a term within a sum by its limit)."
