    "comment": "The student provides a correct final answer using a valid alternative method. The approach involves approximating the inner sum using a single-variable Riemann sum for large k, and then summing the approximations. While the reasoning is sound, it deviates significantly from the grading rubric, which explicitly requires the formulation and evaluation of a double integral. No points were awarded for rewriting the sum over a square domain or identifying the double Riemann integral (Steps 1 & 2). Partial credit (2/5) is given for Step 2 because the student correctly identified that the concept of a Riemann sum is central to the problem. Full credit (3/3) is awarded for Step 3, as the student's final calculation of the limit of the sum is analogous to the evaluation of the outer integral in the rubric's method.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation. The solution does not follow the specific method (double Riemann integral) outlined in the grading rubric, even though the alternative method presented is mathematically valid."
