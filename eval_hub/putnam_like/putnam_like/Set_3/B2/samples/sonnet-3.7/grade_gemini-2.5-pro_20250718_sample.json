    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution using asymptotic analysis, which is a valid alternative to the Riemann sum method described in the grading rubric. The work is rigorous, detailing the expansion of the inner sum and correctly handling the summation of the resulting terms. The final answer is correct. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of limits and series expansions and deserves full credit.",
