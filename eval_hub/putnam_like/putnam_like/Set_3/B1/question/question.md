In the one action the sequence of positive real numbers $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ is transformed into shorter sequence $(\sqrt{x_1x_2},\sqrt{x_2x_3},\sqrt{x_3x_4},\ldots,\sqrt{x_{n-1}x_n})$. After the $(n-1)$ actions there is only one number remaining, call it \emph{result}.
 
 Prove that if we start with the numbers $(1,2,\ldots,n)$ then the result is not greater then $\frac{n+1}2$.
