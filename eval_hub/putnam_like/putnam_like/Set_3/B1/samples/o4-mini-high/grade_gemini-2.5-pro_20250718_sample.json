    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct alternative proof. Although the method differs from the inductive approach outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. The core idea is to compare the iterated geometric mean process with an analogous iterated arithmetic mean process. The student correctly establishes that the result of the geometric process is strictly less than the result of the arithmetic one. They then correctly identify the result of the arithmetic process as a weighted average involving binomial coefficients and evaluate it for the sequence (1, 2, ..., n) to be exactly (n+1)/2, which completes the proof. The solution is both elegant and rigorous.",
