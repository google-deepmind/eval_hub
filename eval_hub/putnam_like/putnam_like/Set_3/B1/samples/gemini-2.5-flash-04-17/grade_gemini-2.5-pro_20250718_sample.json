    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. Although the method used is different from the induction-based approach outlined in the rubric, it is mathematically sound and elegant. The solution correctly derives the general formula for the final result, applies the AM-GM inequality, and correctly computes the resulting weighted arithmetic mean. In a fair grading environment, a valid and correct alternative solution receives full credit.",
