    "comment": "The student presents a fully correct and rigorous proof. While the approach differs from the inductive method outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and insightful alternative. The student correctly derives an explicit formula for the final result, identifies it as a weighted geometric mean, and proves the inequality by comparing it to the corresponding weighted arithmetic mean. This demonstrates a strong command of relevant mathematical concepts. In the context of a mathematics competition, a correct and complete alternative solution merits full credit.",
