    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct alternative proof that is different from the one suggested in the rubric. The solution successfully derives an explicit formula for the final number using induction and then applies the weighted AM-GM inequality. The subsequent calculation of the weighted arithmetic mean using combinatorial identities is flawless. The reasoning is clear, rigorous, and fully justifies the conclusion.",
