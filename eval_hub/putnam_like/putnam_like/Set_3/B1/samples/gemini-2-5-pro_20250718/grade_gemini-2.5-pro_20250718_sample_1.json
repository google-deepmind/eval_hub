    "comment": "The student has provided a complete and rigorous proof that is entirely correct. Although the method used (deriving an explicit formula for the result via logarithms and then applying Jensen's inequality) is different from the inductive approach detailed in the grading rubric, it is a valid and arguably more insightful alternative. The solution is well-structured, clearly explained, and demonstrates a high level of mathematical proficiency. As the provided solution correctly and fully answers the problem, it is awarded full marks.",
