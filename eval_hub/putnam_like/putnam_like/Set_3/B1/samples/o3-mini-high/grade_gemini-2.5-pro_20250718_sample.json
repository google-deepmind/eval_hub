    "comment": "The solution is excellent and fully correct. It presents a rigorous proof by induction on the number of steps taken. While the induction strategy differs from the one suggested in the rubric, it is equally valid and perfectly executed. The base case, inductive step, and final conclusion are all clear, correct, and well-justified.",
