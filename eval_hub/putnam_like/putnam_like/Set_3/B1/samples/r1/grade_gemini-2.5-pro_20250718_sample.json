    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method used (weighted geometric mean and Jensen's inequality) differs from the induction-based approach suggested in the rubric, it is a valid and elegant mathematical proof. The key steps\u2014identifying the binomial weights, applying Jensen's inequality to the logarithm of the result, and correctly calculating the resulting expectation\u2014are all executed flawlessly. Full credit is awarded for this excellent alternative solution.",
