    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly interprets the problem statement, defines all necessary quantities, and proceeds with a clear and logical structure. The calculations for the sum of terms are correct, as is the asymptotic analysis to find the values of alpha and beta. The final squeeze theorem argument to generalize the result from the subsequence to the entire sequence is sound and well-executed. The solution is complete and demonstrates a full understanding of the concepts required.",
