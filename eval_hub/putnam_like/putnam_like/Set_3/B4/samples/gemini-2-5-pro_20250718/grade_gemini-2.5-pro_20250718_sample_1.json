    "comment": "The student correctly identified the structure of the sequence by defining the cumulative index $N_k$ (1 pt) and correctly applied the squeeze theorem to prove the general limit from the subsequence limit (3 pts). However, the central part of the solution, which involves calculating the sum of the series terms to find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, diverges completely from the method outlined in the rubric. The student provided a mathematically correct solution to the problem, but the rubric awards points for a specific (and flawed) computational path which was not followed. Therefore, points for the calculation of the subsequence limit and the determination of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ could not be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Deviation from rubric: The student's calculation of the sum of the series, while mathematically correct, does not match the specific (and flawed) calculation method detailed in the grading rubric, leading to different values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$."
