    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly determines the asymptotic behavior of the sum of the sequence's terms and uses this to find the correct values for alpha and beta. The reasoning is clear, direct, and mathematically sound. The student's approach is different from the one suggested by the rubric, but is entirely correct and arguably more efficient. It correctly solves the problem as stated.",
