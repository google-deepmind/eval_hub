    "comment": "The idea is correct and could lead to a solution, but it is heuristic, not precise (-1pt). The solution is the study of  the special suqsequence of $b_n$, not the whole sequence. This is worth 3 points in the rubric, but it is important that the model not only didn't do it, but also didn't recognized that it is important to be done, so 4 points deducted. The sum of fourth powers is not computed and it is not well known formula (first step, -1 point) ",
