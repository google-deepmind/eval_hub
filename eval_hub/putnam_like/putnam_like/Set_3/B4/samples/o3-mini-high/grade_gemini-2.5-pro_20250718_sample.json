    "comment": "The student correctly interprets the problem, identifies the key quantities, and uses a sound asymptotic analysis to find the correct values for \u03b1 and \u03b2. Points are deducted because the solution lacks the rigorous justification (e.g., via the squeeze theorem) that the limit holds for the entire sequence, not just for the specific subsequence of points at the end of each block, a step which accounts for 3 points in the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof: The solution omits the step required to generalize the limit from a subsequence to the entire sequence."
