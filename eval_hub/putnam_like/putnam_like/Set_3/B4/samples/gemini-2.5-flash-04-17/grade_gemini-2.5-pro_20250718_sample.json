    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The reasoning is clear, and all calculations are accurate. The solution structure correctly identifies the main steps for solving this type of limit problem: analyzing the sequence at block endpoints and then using a squeeze argument to generalize. The student correctly interpreted the problem statement, whereas the provided rubric appears to be based on an incorrect understanding of the sum's definition, leading to different values for \u03b1 and \u03b2. The student's work is flawless.",
