    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the asymptotic behavior of the sum of the sequence elements and the total number of terms, leading to the correct values for \u03b1 and \u03b2. However, the solution is heuristic, relying on approximations rather than rigorous limit calculations. Crucially, the final step of a full proof, which involves using a squeeze theorem to show that the limit holds for all n and not just at the block boundaries, is completely omitted. This final step is worth 3 points in the rubric. It is also noted that the provided grading rubric contains significant errors in its own calculation, leading to an incorrect result for (\u03b1, \u03b2); the student's answer is correct.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of rigor; Omission of a key step. The solution uses approximations which is not a formal proof, and it completely omits the argument needed to show that the limit for the subsequence at block boundaries implies the limit for the entire sequence."
