    "comment": "All details are missed, the usage of approximations is inprecise; it is not written what the symbol $\\approx$ means in this study. Note that for large $M$ blocks are longer and the increment is not bounded. This solution could be valid to study the subsequence of full blocks. However, the study of full sequence is not done.",
