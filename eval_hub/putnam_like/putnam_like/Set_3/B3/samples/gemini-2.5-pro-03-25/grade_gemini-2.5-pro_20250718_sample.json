    "comment": "The student presents a complete and rigorous proof of convergence. While the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a profound understanding of the techniques required for this type of problem. The student correctly uses a product-to-sum identity and then masterfully applies integration by parts to the resulting integrals. The analysis is flawless, including the subtle but crucial step of splitting an integral to avoid a singularity. The solution is exemplary.",
