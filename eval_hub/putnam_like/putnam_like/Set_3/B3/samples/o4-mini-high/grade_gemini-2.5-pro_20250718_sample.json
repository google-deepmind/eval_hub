    "comment": "The student presents a valid and elegant alternative approach by first applying a trigonometric identity. The general strategy of using integration by parts on the resulting oscillatory integrals is correct. However, the proof for the convergence of the integral involving cos(x\u00b2-x) is flawed because it fails to account for the stationary point at x=1/2 where the derivative of the phase vanishes, making the integration-by-parts argument invalid over the entire interval [0, \u221e). The argument should have been applied on an interval excluding this point (e.g., [1, \u221e)). Despite this significant logical gap, points are awarded for the sound overall strategy and the correct analysis of the other resulting integral.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Flaw / Incomplete Proof: The solution incorrectly applies an integration-by-parts argument over an interval where the conditions for its validity are not met (due to a stationary point). There is also a minor sign error in the stated integration-by-parts formula."
