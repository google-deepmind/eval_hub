    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly uses a product-to-sum identity to split the integral into two parts. The convergence of each part is then rigorously proven using a substitution and Dirichlet's Test. Although this method is different from the one in the provided rubric, it is a perfectly valid and complete mathematical argument, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. Therefore, full marks are awarded.",
