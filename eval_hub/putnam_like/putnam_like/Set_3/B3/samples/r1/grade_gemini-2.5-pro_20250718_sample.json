    "comment": "The student reached the correct conclusion using a valid alternative method (product-to-sum followed by integration by parts on the resulting Fresnel-type integrals). However, the provided rubric outlines a very specific path of repeated integration by parts on the original integrand, which the student did not follow. Furthermore, the student's solution is a sketch of the proof, omitting the explicit integration-by-parts calculations. Points are awarded for the correct conclusion and for demonstrating a correct, albeit different, conceptual approach. The score is significantly reduced for failing to follow the rubric's method and for the lack of detailed calculations.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary issue is a deviation from the specified solution method in the rubric. A secondary issue is the lack of detail; the solution describes the steps of integration by parts but does not execute them explicitly."
