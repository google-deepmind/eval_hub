    "comment": "The student provides a fully correct and elegant solution. Although the method used (product-to-sum followed by stationary phase arguments) differs from the integration-by-parts approach outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and sophisticated way to solve the problem. The student correctly identifies the key features of the resulting integrals (monotonic phase vs. stationary phase point) and correctly concludes that the integral is conditionally convergent. The solution demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic, justifying a full score.",
