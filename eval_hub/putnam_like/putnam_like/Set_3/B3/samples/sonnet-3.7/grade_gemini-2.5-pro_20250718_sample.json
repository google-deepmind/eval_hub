    "comment": "The student provides a fully correct and valid solution. Although the method (using a product-to-sum identity and then analyzing Fresnel-type integrals) is different from the integration-by-parts approach detailed in the rubric, it is a standard and arguably more elegant way to solve the problem. The student correctly identifies the necessary conditions for the convergence of the resulting integrals and reaches the correct conclusion. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic.",
