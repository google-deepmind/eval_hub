    "comment": "The solution is flawless. Although the student used a different method than the one outlined in the rubric (product-to-sum identity followed by integration by parts on the resulting Fresnel-type integrals), the approach is mathematically sound, elegant, and executed perfectly. All steps are clearly explained and logically justified, including the correct handling of the singularity in the second integral. Full credit is awarded for a complete and correct solution.",
