    "comment": "The student correctly derived the characteristic polynomial and flawlessly proved the result for the case n=2. The analysis for the number of positive real roots using Descartes' Rule of Signs was also correct. However, the solution fails to provide a general proof for n>=3. The student did not successfully analyze the number of negative roots for the general polynomial, which was a critical step worth 3 points in the rubric. Instead, the solution relies on an unsubstantiated claim about the total number of real roots, making the overall argument for n>=3 incomplete.",
