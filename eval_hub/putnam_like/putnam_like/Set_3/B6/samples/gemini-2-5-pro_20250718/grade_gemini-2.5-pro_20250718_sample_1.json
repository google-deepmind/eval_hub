    "comment": "The student correctly derived the characteristic polynomial and flawlessly analyzed the special case for n=2. The analysis of positive roots using Descartes' rule was also correct. However, the proof for the general case n>=3 is incomplete, as the student did not provide a rigorous argument to bound the number of negative roots, which is a critical step in the provided rubric's solution path.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Proof: The argument for the general case (n>=3) relies on an unsubstantiated claim about the number of real roots. The required analysis of the characteristic polynomial for negative roots was not completed."
