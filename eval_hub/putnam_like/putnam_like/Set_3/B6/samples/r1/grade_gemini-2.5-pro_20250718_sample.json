    "comment": "The student correctly calculates the determinant of the matrix. However, the subsequent argument is based on a significant logical error. The claim that an even total number of eigenvalues contradicts having an odd number of negative real roots is fallacious, rendering the proof invalid. The solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric, and the alternative method presented is not sound. Minimal credit is awarded for the correct determinant calculation.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical error: The proof's central argument relies on a false contradiction regarding the parity of the number of eigenvalues."
