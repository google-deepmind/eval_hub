    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the given matrix as a companion matrix, but then derives an incorrect characteristic polynomial, which is a major error in the first step. The student does not follow the suggested proof method (Descartes' Rule of Signs) but instead attempts an alternative proof by searching for a root on the unit circle. This proof attempt, applied to the wrong polynomial, contains some correct algebraic manipulations but ultimately fails due to a critical logical fallacy: it wrongly assumes that if the magnitudes of two complex numbers are equal, their arguments can be arbitrarily adjusted to establish equality. The final conclusion is therefore not validly supported.",
