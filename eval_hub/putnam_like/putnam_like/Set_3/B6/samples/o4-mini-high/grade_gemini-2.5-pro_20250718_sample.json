    "comment": "The student's solution uses an alternative method (computing the trace of A^2) and does not follow the required approach outlined in the grading rubric, which is based on the characteristic polynomial. The student's own argument is invalid due to a major calculation error in the trace of A^2; the student claims tr(A^2) = -(n-2), while the correct value is n^2-4n+5. Furthermore, the chosen strategy would not work even with a correct calculation. Since none of the steps in the rubric were addressed and the alternative proof is fatally flawed, the solution earns a very low score. A single point is awarded for demonstrating some knowledge of relevant concepts.",
