    "comment": "The student misinterpreted the structure of the matrix A, assuming it had a different subdiagonal structure than the one implied by the standard companion matrix form. This led to the calculation of an incorrect characteristic polynomial, and as a result, the entire subsequent analysis does not solve the posed problem. The solution path in the rubric, which involves finding the correct polynomial and applying Descartes' rule of signs, was not followed. A minimal score is awarded for correctly setting up the problem (i.e., finding eigenvalues via the characteristic polynomial) and for demonstrating a valid, though laborious, method for analyzing the roots of the incorrect polynomial. The student's observation that their result contradicts the prompt for n=2,3 was a good instance of critical thinking, but it stemmed from the initial misinterpretation.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Misinterpretation of the problem statement (matrix structure), leading to an incorrect characteristic polynomial which invalidates the rest of the proof."
