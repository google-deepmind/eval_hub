    "comment": "The solution attempts to solve the problem by examining small cases, which is a good exploratory step but not a substitute for a formal proof. The characteristic polynomial for the n=2 case is correct, earning partial credit. However, the polynomial for n=3 is incorrect, and the crucial step of deriving the general form of the characteristic polynomial is missing. The application of Descartes' rule is flawed (e.g., incorrect sign change count for n=2) and not generalized. The final conclusion about the number of non-real roots is stated correctly but is an unjustified leap, as it is not supported by the preceding flawed and incomplete arguments.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Computational error (incorrect characteristic polynomial for n=3), error in applying a theorem (incorrectly counting sign changes for Descartes' rule), and a major logical flaw (using proof by example and making an unjustified generalization)."
