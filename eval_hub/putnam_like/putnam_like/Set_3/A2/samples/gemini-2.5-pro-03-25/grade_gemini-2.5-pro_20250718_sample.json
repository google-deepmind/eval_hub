    "comment": "The solution is excellent and fully correct. The student first correctly derives the recurrence relation for the polynomials p_n(x) and uses it to prove that p_n(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, which correctly establishes that p(k-1) is an integer. For the second part of the proof, the student provides a valid and rigorous alternative to the method in the rubric, using a Taylor series expansion to demonstrate that k divides p(k-1). The reasoning is clear and well-executed.",
