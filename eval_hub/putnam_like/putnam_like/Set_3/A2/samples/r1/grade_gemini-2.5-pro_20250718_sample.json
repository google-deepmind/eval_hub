    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the inductive nature of the problem and successfully proves the base case for n=1. The final conclusion that p(k-1) is an integer divisible by k also follows correctly from the stated (but unproven) inductive hypothesis. However, the solution completely omits the derivation of the recurrence relation for p_n(x), which is the most critical part of the proof. The inductive step is asserted with a hand-wavy argument rather than being rigorously demonstrated using the recurrence, leading to a significant gap in the logic.",
