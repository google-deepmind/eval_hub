    "comment": "The solution is flawless and earns full marks. The student correctly derives the recurrence relation for the polynomials $p_n(x)$. The proof that $p_n(k-1)$ is an integer is sound. The subsequent proof by induction that $k$ divides $p_n(k-1)$ is also correct and well-argued, successfully handling the cases for odd and even $k$ to complete the demonstration. The level of detail and logical rigor is excellent.",
