    "comment": "The student correctly derives the recurrence relation for $p_n(x)$ and sets up a proof by induction. The argument correctly establishes that $p_n(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and proves the divisibility for odd values of k. However, the proof for even k is incomplete, as it relies on an unproven assertion about the divisibility of the derivative, $p_n'(k-1)$, by k.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof / logical gap. The proof for the case where k is even is based on an unproven claim."
