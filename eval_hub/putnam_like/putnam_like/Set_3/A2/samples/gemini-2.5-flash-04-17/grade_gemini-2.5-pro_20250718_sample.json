    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly derives the recurrence relation for $p_n(x)$. The proof proceeds by induction, first showing that $p_n(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, which immediately establishes that $p_n(k-1)$ is an integer. The main part of the argument, proving divisibility by $k$, uses a detailed and correct inductive proof on the coefficients of $p_n(x)$. This is a valid and rigorous approach that leads to the correct conclusion. The final step correctly uses this result to show $k|p(k-1)$.",
