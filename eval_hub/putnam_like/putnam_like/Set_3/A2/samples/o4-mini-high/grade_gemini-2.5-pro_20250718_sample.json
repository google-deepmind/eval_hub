    "comment": "The solution is very well-structured and the logic is easy to follow. The inductive proofs that p_n(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients and that it is divisible by k for n\u22651 are both flawless. The final conclusion is also correct. Points were deducted because the derivation of the crucial recurrence relation for p_n(x) is invalid. Although the correct recurrence is stated and used effectively, the justification provided using Leibniz's rule does not lead to that specific formula.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect derivation. The student states the correct recurrence relation but provides an invalid derivation. The method shown leads to a different, more complex recurrence, and the jump to the correct formula is a non-sequitur."
