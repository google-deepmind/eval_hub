    "comment": "The solution starts by attempting to find a recurrence relation for the n-th derivative of f(x). However, the derived relation, `(x^k+1)f^(n)(x) + nkx^(k-1)f^(n-1)(x) = 0`, is incorrect for n>1, as it omits terms that arise from applying the product rule (or Leibniz rule) repeatedly. This fundamental error invalidates the entire subsequent derivation of the explicit formula for p(x). Although the final conclusions are correct, they are reached through a completely fallacious argument and therefore earn no credit.",
