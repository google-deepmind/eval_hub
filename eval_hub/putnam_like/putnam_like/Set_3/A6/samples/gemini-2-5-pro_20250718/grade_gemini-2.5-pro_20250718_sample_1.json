    "comment": "The student provided a full and correct proof for the necessary condition that n must be of the form 2m^2. This was achieved via an elegant eigenvalue argument, which is a valid alternative to the method in the rubric, earning full points for the first half of the problem (5/5). For the sufficiency part, which requires constructing such a matrix A, the student explored several promising avenues but did not provide a complete and valid construction. The reduction of the problem to finding a matrix B such that B^2 is the all-ones matrix was a significant insight, for which one point of partial credit is awarded. However, the failure to complete the construction means most of the points for this part (1/5) were not earned.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete solution. The student correctly derived the necessary condition on n, but failed to provide the required construction to prove sufficiency for all valid n."
