    "comment": "The solution correctly establishes that the even-indexed columns of A must be zero and effectively uses a block-matrix decomposition based on odd/even indices. This leads to the key conditions on the submatrices. However, the solution then makes a critical error in assuming that the submatrix A_OO must be a permutation matrix. This incorrect assumption leads to the wrong conclusion that n=2 is the only solution. The analysis misses the general necessary condition (that n/2 must be a perfect square) and consequently fails to provide a construction for the general case, only verifying the simplest case of n=2.",
