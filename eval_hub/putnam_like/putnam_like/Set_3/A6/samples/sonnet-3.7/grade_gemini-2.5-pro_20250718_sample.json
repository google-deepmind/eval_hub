    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the necessary condition that n must be of the form 2m^2. The method used (spectral analysis) is a valid alternative to the rubric's approach, and the calculation of J_n^2 = (n/2)J_n is correct. However, the reasoning to conclude that n/2 must be a perfect square is not fully rigorous. The main weakness is the complete omission of the sufficiency proof; no general construction for a matrix A is provided, which accounts for half the problem's value.",
