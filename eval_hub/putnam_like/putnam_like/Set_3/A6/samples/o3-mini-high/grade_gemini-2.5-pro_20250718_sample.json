    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the final condition on n. However, the solution is severely lacking in justification. For the necessity part, the student outlines an eigenvalue-based approach but makes a critical, unproven assertion that there is exactly one non-zero eigenvalue. This step is essential for the argument to hold but is not justified, for instance by using the trace of A^2. The sufficiency part of the proof, which is worth half the points and requires an explicit construction of the matrix A, is completely absent; the student merely states that such a construction exists.",
