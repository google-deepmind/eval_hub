    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that $n=2$ is a solution and provides a valid matrix A. They also correctly state the property $J_n^2 = (n/2)J_n$. However, the final conclusion that $n=2$ is the *only* solution is incorrect. The argument to rule out other values of n is unsubstantiated and contains logical gaps, as it relies on an unproven assertion. The solution misses the general condition $n=2d^2$ and fails to provide the required construction for these cases.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect conclusion, flawed/incomplete proof, missed generalization."
