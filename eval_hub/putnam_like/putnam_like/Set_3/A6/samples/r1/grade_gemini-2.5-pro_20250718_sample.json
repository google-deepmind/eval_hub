    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that n=2 is a solution and provides a valid matrix A. However, the solution provides none of the required general analysis to derive the necessary condition for n. The argument that no solutions exist for n > 2 is incorrect and is an unsubstantiated claim, thereby missing the complete set of solutions (n must be twice a perfect square). The provided reasoning is insufficient for a proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Flaw / Incomplete Proof: The solution makes a sweeping, incorrect conclusion that n=2 is the only solution based on the failure of a few simple examples, rather than a rigorous mathematical argument. Missed Generalization: The solution fails to find the general necessary condition (n=2d^2) and the corresponding constructive proof for all such n."
