    "comment": "The student correctly derived the necessary condition that n must be of the form 2m^2 for some integer m. The analysis using block matrices is elegant and correct up to that point. However, the solution then incorrectly argues that this condition forces m=1 (and thus n=2) by misapplying a theorem from design theory. This led to an incorrect final set of possible values for n. The general construction for all n=2m^2 is missing, though the case n=2 was correctly verified.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect application of a theorem from combinatorics led to the erroneous conclusion that n=2 is the only solution. The solution is incomplete as it lacks the required general construction for all valid n."
