    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly identifies the integer sequence whose terms are equal to $\\lceil (\\sqrt{11}+3)^{2n}\\rceil$. The author correctly derives the linear recurrence relation for this sequence and uses it to prove the required divisibility property with a well-executed proof by strong induction. The presentation is clear and all steps are logically sound.",
