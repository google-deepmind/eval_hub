    "comment": "The student presents a creative and largely correct solution, differing from the standard approach in the rubric. The core of the argument, proving divisibility using induction and a system of recurrence relations, is executed very well and earns full marks for that section (8/8 points). The initial step of identifying the integer value of the ceiling expression is conceptually sound but contains a logical gap, where a key inequality is asserted without proof. This prevents a perfect score. Overall, this is an excellent and insightful solution.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap: A key inequality was asserted but not proven in the first part of the argument. Minor factual error: An incorrect statement was made about the parity of solutions to a Pell equation, though it did not affect the validity of the overall proof."
