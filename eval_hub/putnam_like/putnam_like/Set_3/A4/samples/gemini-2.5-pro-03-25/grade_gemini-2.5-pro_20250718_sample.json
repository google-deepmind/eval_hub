    "comment": "The solution is excellent and follows a clear, logical progression. It correctly establishes the integer sequence $S_n = (\\sqrt{11}+3)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{11}-3)^{2n}$, shows that it is equivalent to the required ceiling value, finds the correct linear recurrence relation, and provides a rigorous and complete proof by strong induction to demonstrate the divisibility property. All steps are well-explained and mathematically sound.",
