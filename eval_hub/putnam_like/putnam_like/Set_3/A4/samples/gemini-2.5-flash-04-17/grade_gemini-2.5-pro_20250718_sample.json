    "comment": "The solution is flawless and very well-structured. The student correctly identifies the integer sequence a_n whose values are equal to the ceiling expression. They prove that a_n is an integer using a binomial expansion, which is a valid alternative to the method in the rubric. The recurrence relation for a_n is derived correctly. Finally, the proof of divisibility by 2^(n+1) is executed perfectly using strong induction, with the appropriate base cases for n>=1 checked and a correct inductive step.",
