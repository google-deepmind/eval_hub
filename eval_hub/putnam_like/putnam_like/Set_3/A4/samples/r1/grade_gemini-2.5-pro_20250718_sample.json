    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the integer sequence $S_n$ corresponding to the problem expression and demonstrates that it equals the ceiling function (2/2 points). However, they derive an incorrect recurrence relation for $S_n$, which is a major error in the core of the solution (0/6 points). In the final inductive step, the student abandons the incorrect recurrence and uses a different, valid identity, but the argument hinges on a non-trivial lemma about the 2-adic valuation of a related sequence, which is stated without proof. This makes the argument logically incomplete (1/2 points).",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary error is a conceptual mistake in deriving the recurrence relation for the sequence $S_n$. The proof is also logically incomplete due to asserting a key lemma without providing a proof. The solution is presented inconsistently, stating one recurrence relation but using a different identity in the proof."
