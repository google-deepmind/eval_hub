    "comment": "The first statement is correct if we prove that $S_n$ is an integer. The recurrence for $S_n$ is wrong. The solution is based on argument about divisibility of $T_{2k+1}$ and it is mentioned that this fact was proven in lemma, however there is no lemma and any study of $T_{2k+1}$ in this solution.",
