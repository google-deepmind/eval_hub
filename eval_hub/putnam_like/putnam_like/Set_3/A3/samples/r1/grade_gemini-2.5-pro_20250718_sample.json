    "comment": "The student provides a correct and complete solution. While the method (using the general P\u00f3lya urn formula) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (deriving a recurrence relation), it is a valid and sophisticated approach. The student correctly identifies the model, applies the correct formula, and performs the calculations flawlessly to arrive at the correct final answer. Full credit is awarded for a correct alternative solution.",
