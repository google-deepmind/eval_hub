    "comment": "The student has incorrectly interpreted the problem statement, assuming two extra balls are added at each step instead of the stated one. The entire solution is a mathematically sophisticated and largely correct derivation for this different, more complex problem. However, it does not solve the question asked. The method used is also significantly more complicated than the intended solution. A few points are awarded for demonstrating strong knowledge of Polya's Urn schemes and combinatorial identities, but the score remains low as the fundamental problem was not addressed.",
