    "comment": "The student provided a complete and correct solution. Although the method used (identifying the process as a Polya's Urn scheme and applying the Beta-Binomial distribution) differs from the recursive approach outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and sophisticated alternative. All calculations are accurate, leading to the correct final answer. Full credit is awarded for demonstrating a thorough understanding of the underlying probability theory.",
