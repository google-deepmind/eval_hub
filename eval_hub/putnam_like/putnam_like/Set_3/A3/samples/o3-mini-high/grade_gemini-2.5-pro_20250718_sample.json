    "comment": "The student has correctly identified the problem as a P\u00f3lya's urn scheme and applied the appropriate advanced formula for the beta-binomial distribution. However, the solution provided does not follow the derivation method specified in the grading rubric, which requires setting up a recurrence relation, guessing a formula, and proving it by induction. Additionally, the final expression for the probability was not simplified to its numerical value. Since none of the steps outlined in the rubric were present in the student's solution, no points can be awarded.",
