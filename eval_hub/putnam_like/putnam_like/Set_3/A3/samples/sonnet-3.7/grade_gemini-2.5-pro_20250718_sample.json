    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the problem setup and obtains the correct final answer. The chosen method, using the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, is a valid alternative to the recurrence relation outlined in the rubric. However, the core of the solution is the derivation, which is seriously flawed. The application of the distribution's formula contains significant errors in the expansion of the Gamma functions and the algebraic combination of terms. A correct intermediate formula appears later in the solution, but its presence is not justified by the preceding, incorrect steps, which invalidates the logical flow of the argument.",
