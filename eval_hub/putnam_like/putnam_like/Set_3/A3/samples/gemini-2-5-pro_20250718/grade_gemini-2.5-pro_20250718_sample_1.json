    "comment": "The student provides an excellent and complete solution. Although the method differs from the recurrence relation approach in the rubric, the student's combinatorial method for a P\u00f3lya's Urn model is perfectly valid and rigorously executed. The student demonstrates a deep understanding by presenting two correct derivations of the final answer. The reasoning is clear and the calculations are flawless. Full credit is awarded.",
