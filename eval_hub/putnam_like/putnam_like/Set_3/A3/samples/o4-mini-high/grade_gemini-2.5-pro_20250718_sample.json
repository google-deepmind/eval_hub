    "comment": "The final answer is correct and was obtained by correctly identifying the underlying probability distribution (P\u00f3lya's urn / beta-binomial). However, the solution fails to derive the probability formula from first principles using recurrence relations and induction, which constitutes the main part of the problem as outlined in the grading rubric. Points were awarded for identifying the correct general formula (2/7) and for the final numerical calculation (1/1), but no points could be given for the initial steps or the proof of the formula, as this work was omitted.",
