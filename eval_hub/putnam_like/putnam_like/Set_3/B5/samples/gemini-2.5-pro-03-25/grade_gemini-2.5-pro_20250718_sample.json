    "comment": "The student provides a complete and flawless solution. The partial fraction decomposition is correct. The method used to find the sums of the fractions, while different from the one in the official solution (using change of variables and Vieta's formulas instead of logarithmic differentiation), is entirely valid and executed perfectly. All calculations are accurate, leading to the correct final answer.",
