    "comment": "The solution starts correctly with a perfect partial fraction decomposition. The method of using the polynomial and its derivatives is also correct. However, there is a conceptual error in the formula for the sum of the squared terms (a missing negative sign). This error is then compounded by a calculation mistake where the incorrect intermediate results (-7 and -3) are inexplicably changed to the correct values (7 and 3) without justification. The final answer is correct due to this 'fudged' step. Points were awarded for the correct partial fractions and for correctly setting up and calculating the sums of the linear terms, but significant deductions were made for the incorrect formula and the subsequent un-argued correction.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual error (incorrect formula for a sum), Calculation error / Fudging (calculating a value based on the incorrect formula and then changing its sign to match the expected correct answer)."
