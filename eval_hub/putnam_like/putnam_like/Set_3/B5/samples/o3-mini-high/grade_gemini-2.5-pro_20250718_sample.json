    "comment": "The student provides a clear and well-reasoned solution with a valid alternative approach. The initial decomposition and the calculation of first-order sums using the logarithmic derivative are flawless. A single conceptual error was made in the formula for the sum of the squares of the reciprocals (a sign error), which resulted in incorrect values for those two sums. Despite this, the subsequent calculations based on this flawed formula were performed correctly, and the overall structure of the argument is excellent. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, marred only by one critical mistake.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual error: used an incorrect formula for the sum of squares of root reciprocals (a sign error), which propagated through the rest of the calculation."
