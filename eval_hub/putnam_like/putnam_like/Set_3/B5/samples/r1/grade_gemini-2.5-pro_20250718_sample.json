    "comment": "The student provided a complete and correct solution. Although the method used is different from the one outlined in the grading rubric, it is mathematically sound and demonstrates a strong understanding of polynomial manipulation and Vieta's formulas. The student correctly derived the polynomial for y=x^2, transformed it again for z=y-1, and then used properties of the roots of this new polynomial to calculate the required sums, ultimately arriving at the correct final answer. The solution is flawless.",
