    "comment": "The student presents a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one in the rubric, it is equally valid and demonstrates a strong command of polynomial theory. The key steps, including decomposing the expression, finding a new polynomial for the transformed roots, and using Vieta's formulas to calculate the necessary sums, are all executed flawlessly. The final answer is correct.",
