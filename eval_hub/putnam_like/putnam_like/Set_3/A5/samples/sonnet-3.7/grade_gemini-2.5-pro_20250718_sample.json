    "comment": "The student provides two correct and elegant alternative solutions (one using the Fourier Transform, the other using the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma). However, the solution does not follow the specific method detailed in the grading rubric, which allocates 8 points for a derivation using differentiation under the integral sign and solving a differential equation. The student's work bypasses this entire derivation. The score of 2 is awarded for the final step of correctly evaluating the limit of the resulting function, which is the only part of the solution that aligns with the rubric's structure.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation; the solution is mathematically correct but does not follow the specific derivation path outlined in the grading scheme."
