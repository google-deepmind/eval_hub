    "grade": 2,
    "comment": "The student provides three mathematically correct and elegant proofs, demonstrating a strong command of relevant concepts like Fourier transforms, the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, and estimation techniques. However, none of the provided solutions follow the specific method detailed in the grading rubric. The rubric explicitly requires deriving the form of the integral by setting up and solving a differential equation via differentiation under the integral sign (worth 8 points). The student's solutions bypass this entire derivation. The 2 points are awarded because the first method arrives at the correct explicit function for the integral and correctly evaluates its limit, which corresponds to the final step of the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution does not follow the prescribed method outlined in the grading scheme. While the final answer is correct and the reasoning is sound, it fails to demonstrate the specific techniques (differentiation under the integral, solving the resulting ODE) that the rubric is designed to assess."
