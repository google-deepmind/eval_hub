    "comment": "The student provides a correct final answer using a valid alternative method (Fourier Transform). However, the grading rubric is highly specific, awarding 8 points for a detailed derivation using differentiation under the integral sign to form and solve a differential equation. The student's solution does not follow this required method at all, thereby forfeiting the points for that entire section. The student earns 2 points for the final step, which involves correctly evaluating the limit of the explicit function they found for the integral, as this is analogous to the final step in the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodology Mismatch: The solution does not follow the specific method of proof (differentiation under the integral sign) required by the grading rubric. Instead, it uses properties of the Fourier Transform, quoting a standard result without derivation."
