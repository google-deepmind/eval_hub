    "comment": "The student provides two distinct, complete, and correct proofs. The first method correctly derives the exact value of the integral using complex analysis (a valid alternative to the differentiation method in the rubric) and then correctly evaluates the limit. The second method also correctly proves the result using integration by parts and the Squeeze Theorem. The work is exemplary, demonstrating a strong command of multiple advanced techniques.",
