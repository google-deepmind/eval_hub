    "comment": "The provided solution is mathematically correct and presents two elegant methods to arrive at the right answer. However, the grading scheme is based on a specific derivation involving differentiation under the integral sign and solving a differential equation, which accounts for 8 points. The student's solution bypasses this required derivation by quoting the Fourier transform of a Gaussian and the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. While these are valid applications of known theorems, they do not follow the prescribed method. The final 2 points are awarded for correctly evaluating the limit of the resulting function `e^(-y^2/2)`, which is explicitly done in the first method.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution does not follow the specific derivation method outlined in the grading rubric, instead using advanced theorems to reach the conclusion directly. This is a methodological deviation rather than a mathematical error."
