    "comment": "The student provides three distinct, correct, and well-explained proofs for the given problem. Method 1, which finds the explicit form of the integral, aligns with the structure of the rubric's solution, even though the technique (completing the square) differs from the rubric's suggested method (differentiation under the integral sign). The calculation is flawless and the limit is correctly evaluated. The inclusion of two other valid methods (Integration by Parts and Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma) demonstrates exceptional mastery of the topic. The solution is complete and exemplary.",
