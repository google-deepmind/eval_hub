    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and rigorous solution. Although the primary method used (complex contour integration) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (differentiation under the integral sign), it successfully achieves the main goal of the first part: finding a closed-form expression for the integral. The subsequent evaluation of the limit is also flawless. The work demonstrates a strong command of advanced mathematical techniques. An alternative, elegant solution using the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma is also presented, further highlighting the student's understanding.",
