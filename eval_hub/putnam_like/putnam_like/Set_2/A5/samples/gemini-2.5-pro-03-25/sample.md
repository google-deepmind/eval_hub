Solution:

Let $G$ be a finite group of order $|G|=p^n \cdot q^2$, where $p>q>2$ are prime numbers and $n\geq 1$. Let $G' = [G, G]$ be the commutator subgroup of $G$. We are given that $|G'|=q^2$. We want to prove that there exists a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^n$ such that $H$ is abelian and normal in $G$.

Let $H$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. By Sylow's first theorem, such a subgroup exists, and its order is $|H|=p^n$. We will show that this subgroup $H$ satisfies the required properties: $H$ is normal in $G$ and $H$ is abelian.

**Step 1: Prove that $H$ is normal in $G$.**
Let $N_p$ be the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$. According to Sylow's third theorem, $N_p$ must satisfy two conditions:
1. $N_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
2. $N_p$ divides the index of $H$ in $G$, which is $|G:H| = |G|/|H| = (p^n q^2) / p^n = q^2$.

Since $q$ is a prime number, the divisors of $q^2$ are $1, q, q^2$. Thus, $N_p$ must be one of these values.
We analyze the possibilities for $N_p$:

*   **Case 1: $N_p = q$.**
    The condition $N_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ implies $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. This means $p$ divides $q-1$.
    However, we are given that $p > q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are primes, $p \ge 3$ and $q \ge 3$.
    If $p$ divides $q-1$, then $p \le q-1$ (since $q-1 \ge 2 > 0$).
    But $p>q$ implies $p \ge q+1$.
    This leads to $q+1 \le p \le q-1$, which implies $q+1 \le q-1$, or $1 \le -1$, a contradiction.
    Therefore, $N_p = q$ is impossible.

*   **Case 2: $N_p = q^2$.**
    The condition $N_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ implies $q^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. This means $p$ divides $q^2-1 = (q-1)(q+1)$.
    Since $p$ is a prime number, this implies $p \mid (q-1)$ or $p \mid (q+1)$.
    As shown in Case 1, $p \mid (q-1)$ is impossible because $p > q$.
    So we must have $p \mid (q+1)$.
    Since $p$ is a prime and $p > q \ge 3$, we have $p \ge q+1$.
    If $p \mid (q+1)$, then $p \le q+1$.
    The only possibility is $p = q+1$.
    We are given that $q > 2$, so $q$ must be an odd prime. Let $q=2k+1$ for some integer $k \ge 1$.
    Then $p = q+1 = (2k+1)+1 = 2k+2 = 2(k+1)$.
    Since $q \ge 3$, we have $k \ge 1$, which implies $k+1 \ge 2$. So $p = 2(k+1) \ge 4$.
    This means $p$ is an even integer greater than or equal to 4. The only even prime number is 2.
    Therefore, $p$ cannot be prime, which contradicts the given conditions.
    Thus, $N_p = q^2$ is impossible.

The only remaining possibility is $N_p=1$.
If there is only one Sylow $p$-subgroup $H$, then it must be normal in $G$. That is, $H \triangleleft G$.

**Step 2: Prove that $H$ is abelian.**
Let $H' = [H, H]$ be the commutator subgroup of $H$. We want to show that $H' = \{e\}$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.
Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, its commutator subgroup $H'$ is a subgroup of $H$. So $H' \subseteq H$.
The elements of $H'$ are generated by commutators $[h_1, h_2] = h_1 h_2 h_1^{-1} h_2^{-1}$ for $h_1, h_2 \in H$. Since $h_1, h_2$ are also elements of $G$, any commutator $[h_1, h_2]$ is an element of the commutator subgroup of $G$, $G' = [G, G]$. Since $H'$ is generated by such commutators, $H'$ must be a subgroup of $G'$. So $H' \subseteq G'$.
Combining these inclusions, we have $H' \subseteq H \cap G'$.

The order of $H$ is $|H|=p^n$. The order of $G'$ is given as $|G'|=q^2$.
Since $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers, $\gcd(|H|, |G'|) = \gcd(p^n, q^2) = 1$.
The intersection $H \cap G'$ is a subgroup of both $H$ and $G'$. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of $H \cap G'$ must divide both $|H|=p^n$ and $|G'|=q^2$.
Since the greatest common divisor of their orders is 1, the only possibility is $|H \cap G'|=1$.
Therefore, $H \cap G' = \{e\}$.
Since $H' \subseteq H \cap G'$, we must have $H' = \{e\}$.

The condition $H'=\{e\}$ means that for all $h_1, h_2 \in H$, the commutator $[h_1, h_2] = e$. This is equivalent to $h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1$.
Thus, $H$ is an abelian group.

**Conclusion:**
We have shown that any Sylow $p$-subgroup $H$ of $G$ must be normal in $G$ and must be abelian. Since Sylow $p$-subgroups are guaranteed to exist, we have proved the existence of a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^n$ that is both abelian and normal.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{Let H be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. By Sylow's theorems, N_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \text{ and } N_p \mid q^2. Since p>q>2, p \nmid q-1 \text{ and } p \nmid q+1. This forces N_p=1, so H \triangleleft G. The commutator subgroup H'=[H,H] must be a subgroup of H and G'=[G,G]. So H' \subseteq H \cap G'. Since |H|=p^n and |G'|=q^2, H \cap G' = \{e\}. Thus H'=\{e\}, which means H is abelian.}$
