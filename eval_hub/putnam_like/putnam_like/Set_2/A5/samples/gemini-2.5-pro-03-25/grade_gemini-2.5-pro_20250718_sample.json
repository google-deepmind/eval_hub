    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof. The argument for the normality of the Sylow p-subgroup is perfect, correctly analyzing the consequences of Sylow's third theorem with the given prime conditions. The proof that the subgroup is abelian is also correct and elegant, using a direct containment argument ([H,H] \u2286 H \u2229 [G,G]) to show the commutator subgroup of H is trivial. While this approach differs from the specific method suggested in the rubric (which involves an isomorphism theorem), it is a perfectly valid and efficient alternative that demonstrates a full understanding of the material. The solution is flawless.",
