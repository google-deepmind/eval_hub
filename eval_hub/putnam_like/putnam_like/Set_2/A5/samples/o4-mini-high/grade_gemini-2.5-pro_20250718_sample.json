    "comment": "The proof that the Sylow p-subgroup H is abelian is concise, correct, and elegant, earning full credit for that part of the argument. However, the proof that H is normal is critically flawed. It relies on the assumption that q^2 < p, which is not given in the problem statement and is generally false (e.g., p=5, q=3). A valid proof must demonstrate that other possible values for n_p (the number of Sylow p-subgroups) are impossible under the given condition p > q.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical error: The proof for the normality of the subgroup H is based on an unsubstantiated and incorrect assumption (q^2 < p)."
