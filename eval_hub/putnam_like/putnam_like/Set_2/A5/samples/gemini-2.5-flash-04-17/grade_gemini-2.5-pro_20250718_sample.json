    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a deep understanding of group theory. The student correctly proves that the Sylow p-subgroup H is unique and therefore normal, flawlessly executing the steps outlined in the rubric. The proof that H is abelian is particularly insightful; by establishing that G must be a direct product of H and its commutator subgroup, the student correctly deduces a contradiction from the problem's premises (namely that q^2=1), and correctly concludes that this implies H must be abelian. This is a sophisticated and fully correct line of reasoning that is different from, but just as valid as, the one in the rubric.",
