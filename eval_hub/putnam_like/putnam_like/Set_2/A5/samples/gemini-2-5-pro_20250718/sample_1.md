Of course. Here is a detailed, step-by-step solution to the problem.

### **Problem Statement**

Let $G$ be a finite group of order $|G|=p^n\cdot q^2$, where $p>q>2$ are prime numbers and $n\geq 1$.
Assume that the commutator subgroup $[G, G]$ is of order $q^2$. Prove that there exists a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^n$ that is both abelian and normal.

### **Solution**

Our goal is to find a subgroup $H \subseteq G$ that satisfies three properties:
1.  $|H| = p^n$
2.  $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ (denoted $H \trianglelefteq G$)
3.  $H$ is an abelian group.

The proof will be structured in two main steps:
1.  First, we will prove the existence of a normal subgroup $H$ of order $p^n$.
2.  Second, we will prove that this subgroup $H$ must be abelian.

### **Step 1: Existence of a Normal Subgroup of Order $p^n$**

By the definition of the order of $G$, any subgroup of order $p^n$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Let's analyze the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups, which we denote by $n_p$.

According to Sylow's Theorems, $n_p$ must satisfy two conditions:
1.  $n_p$ must divide the index of the Sylow $p$-subgroup in $G$. The index is $\frac{|G|}{p^n} = \frac{p^n \cdot q^2}{p^n} = q^2$.
2.  $n_p$ must be congruent to $1$ modulo $p$. That is, $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

From the first condition, the possible values for $n_p$ are the positive divisors of $q^2$. Since $q$ is a prime number, the divisors of $q^2$ are $1, q, q^2$. We will examine each of these possibilities in light of the second condition, $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

*   **Case 1: $n_p = 1$**
    This case is consistent with both conditions, as $1 \equiv 1 \pmod p$ for any prime $p$. If $n_p=1$, there is only one Sylow $p$-subgroup. A Sylow subgroup is unique if and only if it is normal in $G$. So if $n_p=1$, our desired normal subgroup of order $p^n$ exists.

*   **Case 2: $n_p = q$**
    If $n_p=q$, then we must have $q \equiv 1 \pmod p$. This congruence implies that $p$ divides $q-1$. However, the problem states that $p > q > 2$. Since $p>q$, it is impossible for $p$ to divide $q-1$ (as $q-1$ is a positive integer strictly smaller than $p$). Therefore, $n_p$ cannot be equal to $q$.

*   **Case 3: $n_p = q^2$**
    If $n_p=q^2$, then we must have $q^2 \equiv 1 \pmod p$. This congruence implies that $p$ divides $q^2-1$. We can factor the right side: $p \mid (q-1)(q+1)$.
    Since $p$ is a prime number, this means $p$ must divide at least one of the factors:
    *   $p \mid (q-1)$: As established in Case 2, this is impossible because $p>q$.
    *   $p \mid (q+1)$: This means that $q+1$ is a multiple of $p$. So, $q+1 = k \cdot p$ for some positive integer $k$.
    Since we are given $p>q$, we have $p > q$, which implies $p \geq q+1$.
    If we combine $q+1=kp$ and $p \geq q+1$, we get $q+1 = kp \geq k(q+1)$. Since $q>2$, $q+1$ is positive, so we can divide by $q+1$ to get $1 \geq k$. As $k$ is a positive integer, we must have $k=1$.
    This leads to the equality $p = q+1$.
    Now we use the condition that $p$ and $q$ are primes and $q>2$. Since $q>2$, $q$ must be an odd prime. If $q$ is an odd prime, then $q+1$ is an even number. For $p=q+1$ to be a prime number, it must be the only even prime, which is 2. So $p=2$.
    But this leads to a contradiction with the given condition $p>q>2$. If $p=2$, it cannot be greater than $q$ which is greater than 2.
    Therefore, the case $p=q+1$ is impossible under the given conditions. This means $p$ cannot divide $q+1$.

Since both $p \mid (q-1)$ and $p \mid (q+1)$ lead to contradictions, the possibility $n_p = q^2$ is ruled out.

**Conclusion of Step 1:**
The only possible value for the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups is $n_p=1$. This means there is a unique Sylow $p$-subgroup in $G$. Let us call this subgroup $H$. A unique Sylow subgroup is always a normal subgroup. Thus, we have found a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $|H|=p^n$ and $H \trianglelefteq G$.

### **Step 2: Proving the Subgroup $H$ is Abelian**

Now we need to prove that the normal subgroup $H$ we found in Step 1 is abelian. A group is abelian if and only if its commutator subgroup is the trivial group $\{e\}$. The commutator subgroup of $H$ is denoted by $[H, H]$. We want to show that $[H, H] = \{e\}$.

We are given that the commutator subgroup of $G$, $[G, G]$, has order $|[G, G]| = q^2$.

Let's consider the relationship between $[H, H]$ and $[G, G]$.
Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, any commutator of elements from $H$, of the form $[h_1, h_2] = h_1h_2h_1^{-1}h_2^{-1}$ for $h_1, h_2 \in H$, is also a commutator of elements from $G$. The commutator subgroup $[H, H]$ is generated by all such commutators. Therefore, $[H, H]$ is a subgroup of $[G, G]$.

By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. So, we have:
$|[H, H]|$ must divide $|[G, G]| = q^2$.

Now let's consider the properties of $H$ itself. $H$ is a group of order $p^n$. Any subgroup of $H$ must have an order that divides $|H|=p^n$. The commutator subgroup $[H, H]$ is a subgroup of $H$. Therefore:
$|[H, H]|$ must divide $|H| = p^n$.

So, we have two conditions on the order of $[H, H]$:
1.  $|[H, H]|$ divides $q^2$.
2.  $|[H, H]|$ divides $p^n$.

This means that $|[H, H]|$ must be a common divisor of $p^n$ and $q^2$. The order of $[H, H]$ must therefore divide their greatest common divisor, $\text{gcd}(p^n, q^2)$.

Since $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers, their powers $p^n$ and $q^2$ are coprime. Their only common positive divisor is 1.
Thus, $\text{gcd}(p^n, q^2) = 1$.

This implies that $|[H, H]|$ must divide 1. The only positive integer that divides 1 is 1 itself. So, $|[H, H]| = 1$.

A group of order 1 is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element $e$.
Therefore, $[H, H] = \{e\}$.

A group whose commutator subgroup is trivial is, by definition, an abelian group. Thus, $H$ is abelian.

---

### **Final Conclusion**

We have successfully shown the following:
1.  There exists a unique Sylow $p$-subgroup $H$ of order $p^n$, which is therefore a normal subgroup of $G$.
2.  This normal subgroup $H$ has a trivial commutator subgroup, which means it is abelian.

This completes the proof that there exists a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^n$ that is both abelian and normal.
