    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student provides a complete and rigorous proof for both the normality and the abelian property of the subgroup H. The argument for normality using Sylow's theorems is perfect. The argument for why H is abelian is also correct and elegant, though it follows a different (and equally valid) path than the one outlined in the grading rubric. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and demonstrates a strong command of the material.",
