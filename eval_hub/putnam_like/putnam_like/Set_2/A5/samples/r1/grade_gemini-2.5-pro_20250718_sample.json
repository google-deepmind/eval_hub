    "comment": "The student provides a correct and elegant solution using the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, which is a valid alternative to the Sylow-based approach outlined in the rubric. The key steps of showing the subgroup H is normal and abelian are logically sound. A point was deducted for stating an incorrect formula for the order of Aut([G,G]), although the crucial property of its order being coprime to p was correctly identified and used.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Factual error: The formula provided for the order of the automorphism group of [G,G] is incorrect."
