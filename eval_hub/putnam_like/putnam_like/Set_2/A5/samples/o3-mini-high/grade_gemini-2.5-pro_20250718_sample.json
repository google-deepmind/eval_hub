    "comment": "The proof is well-structured and largely correct. The demonstration that the Sylow p-subgroup H is abelian is excellent, using a clear isomorphism argument. However, the argument for H being normal contains a logical gap. While the conditions on the number of Sylow p-subgroups, $n_p$, are correctly stated, the justification for ruling out the case $n_p=q^2$ is incomplete; the assertion that $q^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ is impossible simply because $p>q$ requires further proof, as this does not immediately follow.",
