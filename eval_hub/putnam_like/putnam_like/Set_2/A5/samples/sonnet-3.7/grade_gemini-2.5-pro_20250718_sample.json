    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. They correctly identify a Sylow p-subgroup as the required subgroup H. The proof that H is normal is sound and follows the standard application of Sylow's theorems. The proof that H is abelian is different from the one suggested in the rubric but is perfectly valid and elegant, correctly using the fact that the orders of H and the commutator subgroup are coprime. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of group theory.",
