    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and well-argued. The student presents a valid alternative proof by considering the function p(t) = det(tA+B). The key insights that this is a polynomial of odd degree (since A is invertible and the size is 2n+1) and that any such polynomial must have a real root are correctly identified and used to solve the problem. This approach, while different from the one in the rubric, is equally rigorous and demonstrates a full understanding of the concepts.",
