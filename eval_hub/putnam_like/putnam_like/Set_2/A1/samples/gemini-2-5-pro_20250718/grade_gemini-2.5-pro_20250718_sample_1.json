    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a standard and mathematically rigorous approach. The problem is correctly reformulated as proving the existence of a real eigenvalue for a real matrix of odd dimension. The argument, which relies on the properties of characteristic polynomials, is flawless and well-explained. Full credit is awarded for this excellent alternative solution.",
