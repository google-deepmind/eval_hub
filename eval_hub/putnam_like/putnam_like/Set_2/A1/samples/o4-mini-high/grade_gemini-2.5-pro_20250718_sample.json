    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant solution. While the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying mathematical principles. The student correctly identifies that `det(aA + bB)` is a homogeneous polynomial of odd degree and then provides two sound arguments (one topological, one algebraic) to prove that it must have a non-trivial real root. The reasoning is clear, concise, and flawless.",
