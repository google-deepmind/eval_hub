    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student provides two complete and correct proofs that demonstrate a deep understanding of the problem. Both proofs correctly utilize the odd dimension of the matrices and apply the Intermediate Value Theorem (or a direct consequence of it) to establish the existence of the required real numbers. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and all conditions of the problem are verified.",
