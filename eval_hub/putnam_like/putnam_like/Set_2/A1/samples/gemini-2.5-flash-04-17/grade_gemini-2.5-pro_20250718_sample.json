    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and standard alternative approach using eigenvalues and the characteristic polynomial. The argument is flawless: the problem is correctly reformulated as finding a real eigenvalue for the matrix AB\u207b\u00b9, which is guaranteed to exist because its characteristic polynomial has an odd degree. The student also correctly shows this eigenvalue must be non-zero. The construction of a and b is correct and all conditions are verified.",
