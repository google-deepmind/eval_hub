    "comment": "The solution is fully correct and provides a valid, elegant proof. It uses an algebraic approach based on the properties of homogeneous polynomials, which is different from the analysis-based approach in the provided scoring key, but is equally rigorous and complete. The key insight that det(aA+bB) is a homogeneous polynomial of odd degree is correctly identified and used to prove the existence of a non-trivial real root.",
