    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and demonstrates a strong understanding of the properties of determinants and polynomials. The argument, based on analyzing the polynomial f(t) = det(A + tB), is elegant and rigorous. By correctly identifying that this is a polynomial of odd degree (2n+1), the student rightfully concludes it must have a real root, which directly leads to the desired conclusion. Although this method differs from the one suggested in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and complete mathematical proof, thus earning full marks.",
