    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and rigorous. While the student used a different method than the one outlined in the grading rubric (employing Beta functions and harmonic number identities instead of direct integration), the approach is valid, and all steps are flawlessly executed. The proof is self-contained and demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. Therefore, full marks are awarded.",
