    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies that an integral representation can be used. The transformation of the right-hand side (RHS) into a double integral expression shows some correct application of series manipulation. However, the solution fundamentally fails in two ways. First, it uses an integral representation for the left-hand side (LHS) that is different from the one required by the rubric's solution path. Second, and more critically, it arrives at two separate, complex integral expressions for the LHS and RHS and then simply asserts they are equal without any proof or further steps. This leaves a major logical gap, and the core of the proof is missing.",
