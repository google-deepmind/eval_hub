    "comment": "The solution is entirely correct and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the problem. The student provides an elegant alternative proof by first transforming the identity into a well-known, but non-trivial, identity involving harmonic numbers. This new identity is then proven rigorously using an integral representation and advanced series manipulation. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the grading rubric, it is a complete and valid proof that fully solves the problem, thus earning full marks.",
