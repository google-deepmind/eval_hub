    "comment": "The student presents a creative and valid alternative approach by starting with a different integral representation. The transformations of both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the identity into series representations are executed skillfully. However, the proof has a major logical gap: it concludes by citing a standard, but non-trivial, binomial-harmonic identity without providing a proof for it. The problem is thus reduced to another difficult identity which is left unproven. Additionally, the method of splitting the integral into two divergent parts is not rigorous, though it ultimately yields the correct intermediate result. The solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric, but credit is given for the correct and insightful steps that were taken.",
