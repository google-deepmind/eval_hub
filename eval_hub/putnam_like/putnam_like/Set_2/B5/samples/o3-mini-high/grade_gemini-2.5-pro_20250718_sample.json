    "comment": "The student presents a valid and creative alternative solution that correctly transforms the left-hand side into an integral, evaluates it, and simplifies it to a different summation form. However, the proof is incomplete. The final, crucial step of showing that this resulting summation is equal to the right-hand side is asserted without proof, by citing a 'well-known identity' and an 'easy partial summation argument' which is not provided and is non-trivial. This constitutes a significant gap in the logical argument.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Gap in reasoning / Unjustified assertion. The solution relies on a non-trivial identity that is stated without proof."
