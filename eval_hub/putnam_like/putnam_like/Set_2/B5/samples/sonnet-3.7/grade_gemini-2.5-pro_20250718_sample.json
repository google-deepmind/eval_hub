    "comment": "The student did not provide a valid mathematical proof. The solution correctly manipulates the right-hand side of the identity and then conjectures that the left-hand side is equal to it. The student then verifies this conjecture for a few small values of n (n=0, 1, 2). This method of 'proof by example' is not a rigorous or general proof. The solution does not follow the required integral-based approach detailed in the rubric, and therefore earns no points for either of the specified solution steps.",
