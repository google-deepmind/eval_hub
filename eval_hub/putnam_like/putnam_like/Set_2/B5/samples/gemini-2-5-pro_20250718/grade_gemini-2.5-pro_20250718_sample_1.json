    "comment": "The student provides a complete and flawless proof. Although the method used (starting with the integral representation \\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\int_0^1 (xyz)^k dxdydz) differs from the specific path outlined in the grading rubric, it is a perfectly valid and elegant alternative. The student correctly transforms the sum using the binomial theorem and then meticulously evaluates the resulting triple integral, demonstrating excellent command of integration techniques and series manipulations. The solution is well-structured, clearly explained, and arrives at the correct final expression.",
