    "comment": "The student correctly performed the partial fraction decomposition, earning full credit for that part. For the summation, the student found a valid and insightful alternative decomposition of the general term but was unable to successfully evaluate the sum. The solution demonstrates significant effort and some good ideas but ultimately does not reach the final answer or follow a complete logical path to the solution.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete reasoning / dead-end: The student found a valid way to decompose the term but could not proceed to evaluate the sum from that point. The solution also contains a minor conceptual error where a convergent series was stated to be divergent."
