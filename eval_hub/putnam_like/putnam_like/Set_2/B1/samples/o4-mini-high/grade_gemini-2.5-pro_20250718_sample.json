    "comment": "The student correctly performs the partial fraction decomposition, earning full credit for the first part of the problem. However, the second and most substantial part of the solution, the evaluation of the infinite series, is completely missing. The student merely states the correct final answer without providing any derivation or justification. The rubric awards 7 points for the detailed process of evaluating the sum, none of which is present in the student's work.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of justification; Missing derivation."
