    "comment": "The student correctly performs the partial fraction decomposition, earning the full 3 points for that step. However, the subsequent evaluation of the sum is incorrect. The student provides only a vague description of the method without showing any valid steps, and the final answer is wrong. The appearance of \u03c0 is unsubstantiated and suggests a guess or a confusion with a different type of series.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Invalid justification; Calculation error. The method for summing the series after decomposition is not shown, and the final result is incorrect."
