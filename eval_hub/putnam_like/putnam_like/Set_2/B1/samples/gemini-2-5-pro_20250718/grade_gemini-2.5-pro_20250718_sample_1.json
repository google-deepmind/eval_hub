    "comment": "The student correctly calculated the partial fraction decomposition of the general term, earning full credit for that step. However, the subsequent attempt to evaluate the sum was unsuccessful. The student fruitlessly searched for a simple telescoping series and did not recognize the cancellation pattern involving harmonic sums that leads to a definite integral, which is the key to solving the problem. The final answer provided is incorrect and lacks any valid justification.",
