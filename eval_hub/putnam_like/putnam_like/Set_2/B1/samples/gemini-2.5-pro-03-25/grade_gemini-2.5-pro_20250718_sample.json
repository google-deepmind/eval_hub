    "comment": "The student correctly performs the partial fraction decomposition, which is equivalent to the one in the rubric. Although the student does not follow the summation method outlined in the rubric, they provide two complete, valid, and more advanced alternative solutions. The first method uses the digamma function, and the second uses an integral representation. Both methods are executed flawlessly and arrive at the correct final answer. The work is exceptionally clear and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic.",
