    "comment": "The partial fraction decomposition is correct and earns full credit for that step. However, the subsequent evaluation of the sum contains significant errors. While the approach of using the Digamma function is valid, the sum was incorrectly split into divergent series. Furthermore, after correctly formulating the result in terms of Digamma functions, an incorrect value was asserted without justification, leading to the wrong final answer. Partial credit is awarded for correctly identifying the sum in terms of Digamma functions.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual Error: The solution incorrectly splits the series into a sum of divergent series. Factual Error: The value of the resulting expression in terms of Digamma functions is incorrectly stated without proof, leading to a wrong final answer."
