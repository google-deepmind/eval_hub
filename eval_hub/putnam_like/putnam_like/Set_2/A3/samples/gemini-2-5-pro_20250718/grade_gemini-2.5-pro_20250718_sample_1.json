    "comment": "The solution correctly sets up the problem by expanding the integrand into a power series and integrating term-by-term. The subsequent splitting of the series into even and odd terms and the algebraic manipulation are also correct. However, the solution fails to derive the formula for the Wallis integrals ($\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\sin^n x\\,dx$), which is a major component of the proof worth 7 points according to the rubric. The formulas were stated without proof, resulting in a significant loss of points.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a major proof component. The derivation of the Wallis integral formulas via integration by parts was completely omitted."
