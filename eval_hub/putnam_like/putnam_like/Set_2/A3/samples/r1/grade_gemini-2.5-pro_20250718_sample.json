    "comment": "The student correctly set up the problem by expanding the integrand into a Taylor series and splitting the resulting sum into even and odd terms. The manipulation of the series to arrive at the final expression is also correct, earning the 3 points allocated for this part of the proof. However, the solution completely omits the derivation of the Wallis integrals (I_n), which is a major component of the proof worth 7 points according to the rubric. The formulas for these integrals are stated without proof.",
