    "comment": "The solution is very well-structured and demonstrates a strong understanding of the required concepts. The student correctly applies the Taylor series for the exponential function, justifies the interchange of summation and integration, and correctly evaluates the resulting series by splitting it into even and odd terms. The derivation of the closed forms for the Wallis integrals from the recurrence relation is also excellent. However, points were deducted because the recurrence relation for the Wallis integrals was stated without derivation. The rubric details this derivation via integration by parts, indicating it is a required step for full credit.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a key proof step. The solution states the recurrence relation for the Wallis integrals without providing the derivation (via integration by parts), which is a significant part of the first section of the provided grading scheme."
