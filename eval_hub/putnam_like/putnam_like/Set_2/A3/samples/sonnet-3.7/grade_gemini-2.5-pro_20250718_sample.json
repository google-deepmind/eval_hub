    "comment": "The student correctly expanded the integrand as a power series, split the sum into even and odd terms, and manipulated the series to match the target expression. This corresponds to the 3 points awarded for the second part of the rubric. However, the solution completely omits the derivation of the formulas for the integrals of powers of sine (the Wallis integrals), which was a major requirement worth 7 points. The formulas were stated without any proof or justification.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major Omission of Proof: The required derivation for the Wallis integrals was skipped entirely."
