    "comment": "The student correctly applies the Taylor series for the exponential function and successfully manipulates the resulting series by splitting it into even and odd terms to reach the final expression. This corresponds to the second part of the rubric, earning 3 points. However, the solution completely omits the derivation of the integral for sin^n(x) (the Wallis integral), which is worth 7 points. The formulas are stated without proof, which is a major omission.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major omission: The solution fails to derive the value of the Wallis integral for sin^n(x), instead stating it as a known result. This derivation accounts for 7 of the 10 available points."
