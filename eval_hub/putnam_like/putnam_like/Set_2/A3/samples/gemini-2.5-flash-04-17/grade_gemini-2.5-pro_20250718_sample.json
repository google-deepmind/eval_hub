    "comment": "The student correctly expanded the integrand into a Taylor series, justified term-by-term integration, and correctly manipulated the resulting series to arrive at the final expression. This part of the solution is flawless and earns 3 points. However, the solution fails to derive the formula for the Wallis integral, $I_n = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin^n(x) dx$, using integration by parts, which was a major requirement worth 7 points. The student simply stated the result without providing the necessary derivation.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a required derivation. The solution quotes the formula for Wallis' integrals without deriving it as specified in the grading scheme."
