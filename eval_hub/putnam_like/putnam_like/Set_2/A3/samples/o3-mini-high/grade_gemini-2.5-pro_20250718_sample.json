    "comment": "The student correctly applies the Taylor series expansion for e^x, interchanges integration and summation, and manipulates the resulting series correctly by splitting it into even and odd terms to reach the final expression. This work corresponds to the 3 points available in the second part of the rubric. However, the solution entirely omits the derivation of the Wallis integral formulas for \u222bsin^n(x) dx, instead stating them as known results. This derivation is worth 7 points, and its omission is a major gap in the proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a major part of the proof. The derivation of the Wallis integral formulas was skipped."
