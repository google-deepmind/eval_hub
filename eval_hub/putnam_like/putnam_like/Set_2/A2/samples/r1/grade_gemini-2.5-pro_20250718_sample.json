    "comment": "The solution flawlessly applies the equality condition of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The subsequent analysis is excellent and complete, correctly using the continuity of g to argue that g must be constant if f is not identically zero, and also correctly identifying that any continuous g is a solution if f is identically zero. The reasoning is rigorous and covers all cases, demonstrating a full understanding of the problem.",
