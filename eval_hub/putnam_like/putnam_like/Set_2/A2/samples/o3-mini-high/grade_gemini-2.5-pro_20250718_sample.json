    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the given equation as the equality case of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals. The argument is well-structured and rigorous. The student correctly deduces the relationship between the functions and uses the continuity of `g` to arrive at the solution. The analysis is excellent and correctly handles all cases, including the special case where `f` is identically zero, which was a crucial detail.",
