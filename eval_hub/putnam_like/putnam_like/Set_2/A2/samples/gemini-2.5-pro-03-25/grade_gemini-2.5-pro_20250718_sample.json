    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the given equation as the equality case of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)f(x)$. The resulting condition for equality, $g(x)f(x) = c f(x)$, is then expertly analyzed. Unlike the provided rubric which incorrectly assumes $f(x)$ is non-zero, this solution correctly handles the general case where $f(x)$ may be zero at some points. The argument, using the continuity of $g$ to determine its values on the zeros of $f$, is rigorous and complete. The final characterization of the solution set is entirely correct.",
