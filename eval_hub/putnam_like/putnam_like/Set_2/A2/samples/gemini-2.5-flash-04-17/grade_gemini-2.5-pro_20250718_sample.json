    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the given equation as the equality case of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The analysis of the equality condition is comprehensive and rigorous, correctly handling all possible cases for the function f, including those where f(x)=0 for some or all x. The use of continuity to determine the behavior of g on the closure of the set where f is non-zero is particularly well-reasoned. The final characterization of the solution set is precise and complete. The student's solution is superior to the one outlined in the rubric, which oversimplifies the problem by assuming f is non-zero everywhere.",
