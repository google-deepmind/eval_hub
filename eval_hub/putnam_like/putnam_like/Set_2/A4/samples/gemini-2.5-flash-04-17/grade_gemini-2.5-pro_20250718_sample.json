    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly identifies the characteristic polynomial and uses a sound and equivalent method based on the minimal polynomial to derive the correct system of linear equations for the coefficients. The derivation via differentiation is correct, the system is solved without error, and the final expressions for the coefficients are correct. The reasoning is clear and mathematically rigorous.",
