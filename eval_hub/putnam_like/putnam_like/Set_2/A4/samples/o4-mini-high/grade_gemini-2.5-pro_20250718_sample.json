    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant solution. Instead of the polynomial division method outlined in the rubric, the student cleverly uses the fact that M can be written as I+N where N is a nilpotent matrix and then applies the binomial theorem. The derivation is flawless and all coefficients are correct. Full credit is awarded for this excellent alternative approach.",
