It correctly identifies the characteristic polynomial, applies the polynomial remainder theorem in conjunction with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, and accurately solves for the coefficients by differentiating and evaluating at the eigenvalue. All calculations are correct and the reasoning is clearly articulated. A perfect score.",
