    "comment": "The student identifies the correct characteristic polynomial and uses a valid alternative method based on recurrence relations. The recurrence system and final coefficients are correct. However, the solution is severely penalized for omitting the derivation of the recurrence relations and, most critically, for providing no work on how this system of recurrences was solved to obtain the final coefficients. This leap of logic skips the main computational part of the problem, which corresponds to the 6-point step in the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of key steps; Lack of justification. The solution jumps from a system of recurrence relations to the final answer without showing the intermediate steps required to solve them."
