    "comment": "The student presents an elegant and non-standard approach by introducing an auxiliary function $h(x) = x^2 f(x)$, and the initial transformation of the equation is correct. However, the proof contains a critical algebraic error in step 2 when substituting $y=x$. The term $2x^2h(x^2)$ is incorrectly written as $2x^2h(x)$, which leads to the unjustified conclusion that $h(x^2)=h(x)$. This error invalidates the entire logical foundation of the proof, as the deduction that $h(x)$ is constant relies on this false premise. Credit is given for the correct initial substitution and for the final step which correctly shows that if $f(x)$ has the form $k/x^2$, then $k$ must be 1. However, since the core argument is fundamentally flawed, the solution earns a low score.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major calculation error; Flawed logical deduction. A crucial substitution error was made ($h(x^2)$ was replaced by $h(x)$), which trivialized the problem and invalidated the main line of reasoning."
