    "comment": "The solution is flawless and presents a very elegant argument. After correctly establishing the function's values at integers, the student cleverly uses an auxiliary function to prove the solution form f(x)=1/x^2 for all rational numbers. This method, while different from the rubric's suggested path, is fully rigorous. The final step extending the result to all positive real numbers via continuity is also perfect. The work earned 11/10 points based on the rubric, so the final score is capped at 10.",
