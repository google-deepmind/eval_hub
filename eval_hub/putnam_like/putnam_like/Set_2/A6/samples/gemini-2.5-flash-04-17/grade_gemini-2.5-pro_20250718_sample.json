    "comment": "The solution is flawless and elegant. The introduction of the auxiliary functions g(x)=1/f(x) and h(x)=g(x)-x^2 significantly simplifies the argument. All steps are logically sound, from finding f(1)=1 to establishing the form of the function on the rationals, and finally extending it to all positive reals using continuity. The solution successfully covers all key logical steps outlined in the rubric, albeit via a more insightful path. The final verification is also a nice touch. A perfect score.",
