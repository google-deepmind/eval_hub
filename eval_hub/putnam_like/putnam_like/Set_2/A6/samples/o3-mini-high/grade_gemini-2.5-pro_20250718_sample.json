    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the function f(x) = 1/x^2 and provides a complete verification that it satisfies the equation. However, the method used to find the function is based on an 'ansatz' (assuming the solution has a specific form, namely 1/(Ax^2+B)). This approach is not a rigorous proof and, crucially, fails to demonstrate that this is the unique solution as required by the problem. The solution does not contain any of the required deductive steps from the grading rubric, which build a rigorous proof of uniqueness by establishing the result for integers, then rationals, and finally for all positive reals. As no part of the rubric's required proof structure was followed, no points can be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical flaw / Unjustified assumption. The solution's entire argument relies on an unproven assumption about the polynomial form of the function. This fails to prove the uniqueness of the found solution, which is a critical requirement of the problem statement to 'Find all' such functions."
