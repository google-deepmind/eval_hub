    "comment": "The student found the correct solution f(x)=1/x^2 and verified it. However, the problem requires a proof of uniqueness to find *all* solutions. The submitted work consists of a guess-and-check, which does not constitute a proof and does not follow any of the required deductive steps from the rubric (e.g., proving the result for rational numbers first and then extending by continuity). Therefore, no points are awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution provides a guess and verification instead of a rigorous proof. It fails to prove that the found solution is unique, which is essential for a 'find all' problem."
