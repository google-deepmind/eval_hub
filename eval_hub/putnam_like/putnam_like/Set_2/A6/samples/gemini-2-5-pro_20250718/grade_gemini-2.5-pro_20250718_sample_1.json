    "comment": "The student provides a complete and flawless proof. While the method differs significantly from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and arguably more elegant alternative. The student correctly determines that f(1)=1, satisfying the first step of the rubric. Subsequently, instead of building the solution from integers to rationals, the student introduces an auxiliary function k(x) = 1/f(x) - x^2 and proves it must be identically zero for all x in R+. This rigorous argument establishes the uniqueness of the solution f(x)=1/x^2, accomplishing the overall goal of the rubric.",
