    "comment": "The student correctly identifies and verifies the solution f(x) = 1/x^2. The strategy to prove uniqueness by defining g(x) = 1/f(x) and h(x) = g(x)/x^2 is clever. However, the solution contains a critical flaw: the functional equation derived for h(x) is incorrect due to an algebraic error during substitution. While the subsequent reasoning appears to show h(n)=1 for integers, it is based on this faulty equation and also contains a logical gap in establishing the base case h(1)=1. The most substantial part of the proof, extending the result to all rational numbers (worth 6 points in the rubric), is completely omitted and replaced by a hand-waving statement. The only part of the uniqueness proof that aligns with the rubric and is correctly executed is the final step, which uses the continuity of f to extend the result from rational numbers to all positive real numbers. Therefore, points are awarded only for this final step.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major algebraic error, circular reasoning, logical gap, omission of a required proof step."
