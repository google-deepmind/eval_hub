    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies that it is sufficient to analyze the derivative of the squared norm. All steps, including the differentiation, the calculation of A(t)+A(t)^T, and the proof of positive definiteness for the resulting matrix, are executed perfectly. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and mathematically sound, including the justification for why x(t) is never zero. The conclusion follows logically from the derived results.",
