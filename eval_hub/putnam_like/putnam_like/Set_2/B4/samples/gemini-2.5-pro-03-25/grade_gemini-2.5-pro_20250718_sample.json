    "comment": "The student provides a complete and well-structured solution. All necessary steps are present and justified correctly. The derivative of the squared norm is correctly calculated and expressed as a quadratic form. The matrix A(t) + A^T(t) is correctly computed and shown to be positive definite. The crucial argument that the solution x(t) is never zero, based on the uniqueness theorem for ODEs, is also correctly stated and used to establish that the derivative is strictly positive.",
