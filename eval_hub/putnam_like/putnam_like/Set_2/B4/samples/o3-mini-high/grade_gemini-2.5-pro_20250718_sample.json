    "comment": "The solution is very well-structured and mathematically sound. The student correctly identifies that the proof hinges on the positive definiteness of A(t)+A(t)^T. The calculation of this matrix is correct, as is the argument for its positive definiteness. The only minor point of weakness is that the solution does not explicitly justify why x(t) remains non-zero for all t, which is a consequence of the uniqueness of solutions for the initial value problem. This point is mentioned in the rubric as being worth 2 points, and the justification provided by the student is somewhat incomplete. The main part of the argument, worth 8 points, is executed flawlessly.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete justification. The solution correctly states that x(t) is non-zero but does not provide the underlying reason based on the uniqueness theorem for solutions of ODEs."
