    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies that the proof hinges on the sign of the derivative of the squared norm, ||x(t)||^2. The calculation of this derivative in terms of the symmetric part of A(t) is correct. The argument for the positive definiteness of the resulting quadratic form is sound and well-justified. The crucial point that x(t) is never the zero vector (due to uniqueness and the initial condition) is also correctly stated and used to complete the proof. The logic is clear and every step is well-explained.",
