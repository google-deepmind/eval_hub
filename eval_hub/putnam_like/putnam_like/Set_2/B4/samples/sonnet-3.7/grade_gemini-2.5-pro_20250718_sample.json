    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly identifies the strategy of examining the sign of the derivative of the norm. The derivative is computed correctly, and the key step of analyzing the matrix A(t) + A(t)^T is handled perfectly. The student correctly shows this matrix is positive definite and uses the uniqueness of ODE solutions to ensure x(t) is never zero, leading to the correct conclusion. The logic is clear and well-presented.",
