    "comment": "The core of the argument, showing that the derivative of the squared norm is positive, is flawlessly executed. The student correctly computes the symmetric part of the matrix A(t) and correctly argues for its positive definiteness based on its diagonal entries. However, the solution fails to justify a crucial preliminary step mentioned in the rubric: why $x(0) \\neq 0$ implies $x(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t$. This step, which relies on the uniqueness of solutions to the ODE, is necessary for the main argument to hold and is worth 2 points.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a required justification. The solution assumes that if the initial condition is non-zero, the solution remains non-zero for all time without providing a reason (e.g., uniqueness of solutions)."
