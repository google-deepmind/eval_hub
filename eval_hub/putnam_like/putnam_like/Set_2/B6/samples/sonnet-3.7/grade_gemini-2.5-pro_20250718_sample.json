    "comment": "The solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric, which involves defining parameterized functions and using differential equations. The alternative approach of evaluating each integral separately is based on incorrect formulas for the integral values. Since the entire proof rests on these false premises, it is invalid and does not demonstrate the equality of the integrals.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical error: The proof is based on citing two non-existent/incorrect integral identities. Methodological deviation: The solution completely ignores the required approach detailed in the grading rubric."
