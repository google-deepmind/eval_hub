    "comment": "The provided solution is mathematically interesting but does not follow the method outlined in the grading rubric, which is based on differentiation under the integral sign and solving a resulting differential equation. As the solution follows a completely different path (contour integration), it does not meet the requirements of any step in the rubric. Therefore, no points can be awarded. Additionally, the alternative proof presented contains significant errors. While the initial transformations are mostly correct, the proof mistakenly equates the left-hand-side integral with an integral involving sin(x), not cos(x), and then tries to resolve this discrepancy by asserting a false identity.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution fails to follow the prescribed method from the rubric. The alternative proof provided contains critical mathematical errors, including misidentifying the real and imaginary parts of a complex integral in the context of the problem statement and asserting a false mathematical identity as a final step."
