    "comment": "The student attempts an alternative solution using integral representations and Laplace transforms. While some technical calculations within the solution are correct, the overall logical structure is critically flawed. The key step of swapping the order of integration for the second integral is not justified, a fact the student notes but then incorrectly ignores. This invalidates the main line of argument. Although this flawed step coincidentally leads to a correct reformulation of the problem, the student's final analysis of this new integral using special functions is also incorrect, leading to the false conclusion that the original identity is wrong. Points are awarded for demonstrating some correct technical skills, but the solution fails due to major logical errors.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Fallacy; Incorrect Conclusion. The solution's main argument relies on an invalid interchange of integrals. After correctly noting that the conditions for Fubini's theorem are not met, the student proceeds with the interchange anyway, which is a major error. This leads to a subsequent incorrect conclusion about the validity of the problem statement."
