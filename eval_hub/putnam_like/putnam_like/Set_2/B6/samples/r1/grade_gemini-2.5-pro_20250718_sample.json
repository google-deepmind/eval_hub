    "comment": "The student uses a valid alternative method involving integral transforms and differentiation under the integral sign. The calculations to transform the right-hand side and relate it to the derivative of the left-hand side are correct and demonstrate significant skill. However, the final step, which should connect these results to prove the equality, is completely missing and replaced by an unsubstantiated assertion. A proof cannot be considered complete without this crucial logical connection. (Note: The problem statement as provided is incorrect, which makes a valid proof impossible. The grade reflects the correct partial work on an impossible problem, while penalizing the logical leap taken to force a conclusion.)",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof / Unsubstantiated claim. The solution correctly executes several advanced steps but fails to provide the final argument connecting them, instead asserting the conclusion."
