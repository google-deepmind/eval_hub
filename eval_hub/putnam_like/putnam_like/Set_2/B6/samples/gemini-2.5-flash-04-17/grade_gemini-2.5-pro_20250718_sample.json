    "comment": "The student uses a valid but different method from the one in the rubric. They correctly use Laplace transforms to reframe the problem and then derive a correct second-order non-homogeneous differential equation for the integral in question. This shows significant skill. However, the student does not solve this differential equation; instead, they cite a known identity involving special functions which is equivalent to the problem statement, leaving the proof incomplete. The chosen method is also more complex than the intended solution, which leads to this difficulty. Credit is awarded for the correct derivations, but points are deducted for the incomplete final argument.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof; Reliance on an unproven identity."
