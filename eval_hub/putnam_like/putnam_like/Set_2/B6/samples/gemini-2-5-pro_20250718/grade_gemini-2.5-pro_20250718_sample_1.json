    "comment": "The student did not use the method outlined in the rubric, opting for a valid alternative approach using Fubini's theorem. The student correctly executed the difficult transformations of both integrals, demonstrating significant technical skill. However, the proof is incomplete. The student only managed to reduce the problem to another non-trivial integral equality, but failed to prove it, instead asserting its truth by appealing to the problem statement. The remainder of the solution digresses to solve a different problem based on a conjectured typo. The grade reflects the substantial and correct partial work done on the original problem.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Proof / Logical Gap: The solution reduces the problem to a new identity but fails to prove it, leaving a critical gap in the argument. The student also spends significant effort proving a result for a different problem than the one assigned."
