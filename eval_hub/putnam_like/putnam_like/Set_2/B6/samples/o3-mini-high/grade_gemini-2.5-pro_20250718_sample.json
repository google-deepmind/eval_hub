    "comment": "The student identifies a valid alternative strategy using Laplace transforms and correctly transforms the second integral. However, the solution has two major flaws. First, the manipulation of the first integral is circular, leading back to the original integral without making progress. Second, and most critically, the proof is incomplete. The student does not prove the equality of the two resulting integrals but instead cites a known theorem that is equivalent to the problem statement, which constitutes circular reasoning.",
