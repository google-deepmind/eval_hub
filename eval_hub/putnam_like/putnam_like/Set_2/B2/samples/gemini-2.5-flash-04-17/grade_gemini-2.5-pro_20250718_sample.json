    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly establishes that any eigenvalue of the matrix must be a real root of the polynomial $P(x) = x^{4m+1}+x^{4m}+x^{2m+1}+x^{2m}+x+1$. The student correctly factors the polynomial and provides a rigorous and complete proof that $x=-1$ is the only real root. The conclusion that the matrix must be $A=-I$ is well-justified by the fact that a real symmetric (and thus diagonalizable) matrix with only one eigenvalue must be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. The final verification is a good demonstration of thoroughness.",
