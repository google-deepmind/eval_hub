    "comment": "The solution is flawless and elegant. The student correctly applies the spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices, establishing that the eigenvalues must be real roots of the characteristic polynomial. The factorization of the polynomial and the argument that -1 is the only real root are both correct. The conclusion that A must be the negative identity matrix is well-reasoned and accurate.",
