    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that since A is symmetric, it is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. The polynomial satisfied by the eigenvalues is correctly factored, and it's correctly argued that -1 is the only real root. The final conclusion that A must be -I is also correct and well-reasoned. However, the solution omits the proof that the eigenvalues of A must satisfy the polynomial equation. As the rubric provides a detailed breakdown of this proof, its omission leads to a deduction of points from the main 8-point section.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of proof: The solution asserts that the eigenvalues must satisfy the given polynomial equation but does not provide a formal proof for this step, which is detailed in the grading scheme."
