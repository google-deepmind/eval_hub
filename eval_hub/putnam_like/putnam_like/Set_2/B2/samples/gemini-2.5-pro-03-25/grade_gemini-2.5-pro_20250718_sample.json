    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem. The student correctly uses the property that a real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. The argument proceeds by showing that any eigenvalue must be a real root of the polynomial $P(x)$, which is correctly factored to find the unique real root $x=-1$. This correctly leads to the conclusion that the only possible matrix is $A=-I$. The final verification step is a nice touch that confirms the result.",
