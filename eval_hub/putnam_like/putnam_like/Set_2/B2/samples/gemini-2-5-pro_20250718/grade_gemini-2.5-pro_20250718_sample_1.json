The student correctly identifies that any eigenvalue must be a real root of the characteristic polynomial, factors the polynomial to find the unique real root \u03bb=-1, and uses the diagonalizability of the symmetric matrix A to correctly conclude that A must be the negative identity matrix. The argument is clear, well-structured, and even includes a verification step.",
