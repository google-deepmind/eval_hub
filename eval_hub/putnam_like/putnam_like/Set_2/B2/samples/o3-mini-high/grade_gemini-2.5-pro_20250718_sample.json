    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies that any eigenvalue must be a real root of the polynomial associated with the matrix equation. The student correctly factors this polynomial, demonstrates that -1 is the only real root, and correctly uses the fact that a symmetric matrix is diagonalizable to conclude that A must be the negative identity matrix. All steps are logically sound and clearly presented.",
