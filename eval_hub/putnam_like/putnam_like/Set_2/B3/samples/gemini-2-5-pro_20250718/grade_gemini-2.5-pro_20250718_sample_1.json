    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof by induction. The base case is correctly established for n=0. The inductive step correctly uses the factorization and shows that the two factors share no odd prime divisors. The proof that the new factor contributes a new odd prime is handled meticulously, with a correct case distinction that demonstrates a strong understanding of the problem's subtleties. The logic is flawless.",
