    "comment": "The solution presents a valid and elegant alternative proof strategy by factoring the expression completely and showing the corresponding terms are pairwise coprime (in their odd parts). The core number theory argument for the coprimality is correct and well-executed. However, the proof contains errors and a significant logical gap. It incorrectly states that certain intermediate factors are all odd, and it fails to justify why these factors must be greater than 1, which is essential for the final counting argument to hold. The conclusion is therefore not rigorously established.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Factual error regarding the parity of the factors; logical gap due to an unproven assumption that the factors used for counting primes are all greater than one."
