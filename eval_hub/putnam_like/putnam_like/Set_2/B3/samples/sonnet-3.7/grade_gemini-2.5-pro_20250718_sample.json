    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the inductive structure of the proof, successfully proves the base case, and correctly sets up the inductive step. The argument that the two main factors, (a^(2^k)-1) and (a^(2^k)+1), share no odd prime divisors is sound (Step 3). However, the proof that the second factor, (a^(2^k)+1), must contain an odd prime divisor is incomplete. The solution attempts a difficult proof by contradiction but hand-waves the critical step, asserting without justification that the equation a^(2^k)+1=2^t is impossible. A much simpler argument using modular arithmetic (modulo 4) as described in the rubric was missed.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Proof / Argument by Assertion. The solution fails to rigorously prove a key claim ('Step 4'), instead stating it can be shown without providing the necessary steps. This logical gap occurs in a central part of the inductive argument."
