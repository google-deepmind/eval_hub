Although the method used (direct factorization and analysis of the greatest common divisor of the factors) is different from the inductive approach outlined in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and powerful alternative. The argument is well-structured, showing that the odd parts of the factors are pairwise relatively prime and that a sufficient number of them are greater than 1 to guarantee at least n distinct odd prime factors. Combined with the prime factor 2, this correctly establishes the result. The solution is flawless.",
