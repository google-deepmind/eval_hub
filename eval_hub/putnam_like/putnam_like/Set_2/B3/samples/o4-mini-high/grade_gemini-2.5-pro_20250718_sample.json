    "comment": "The solution presents a valid and elegant alternative to an inductive proof. The core argument, proving that the factors of the form (2m+1)^(2^k)+1 have disjoint sets of odd prime divisors, is correct and demonstrates a deep understanding. This corresponds to the most difficult part of the problem. However, the proof is incomplete because the final step, arguing that each of the n+1 factors in the chosen factorization must contribute a new prime, contains significant logical gaps and unhandled cases (e.g., when m is a power of 2).",
