    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof that is mathematically sound. Although the method used (factorization of $a^{2^n}-1$) differs from the induction approach suggested in the rubric, it is a valid and well-executed alternative. The key steps are all present and correct: the factorization, the proof that $\\gcd(a^{2^j}+1, a^{2^k}+1)=2$, the proof that these factors contain odd primes for $k \\ge 1$, and the careful case analysis on the remaining factors $a-1$ and $a+1$. Since the problem statement did not mandate a specific proof method, this excellent alternative solution deserves full credit.",
