    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies mathematical induction as the proof strategy, establishes a valid base case for n=0, and correctly factorizes the expression in the inductive step. The argument that the GCD of the two factors is 2 (by showing A/2 and B/2 are coprime) is a good insight. However, the proof contains a critical flaw in the inductive step. The solution asserts that the new factor, (2m+1)^(2^k)+1, introduces a new prime divisor but fails to prove this. This assertion is not always true under the chosen induction scheme (starting from n=0), as the new factor can be a power of 2 for the k=0 case (e.g., if m+1 is a power of 2). This unproven and sometimes false claim represents a major logical gap in the core of the argument.",
