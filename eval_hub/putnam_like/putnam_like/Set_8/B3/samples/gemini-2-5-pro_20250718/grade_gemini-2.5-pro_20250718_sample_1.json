    "comment": "Excellent solution. Both inequalities are proven rigorously and clearly. The use of a change of variables for the right-hand inequality and the application of a lemma (related to the Second Mean Value Theorem for Integrals) for the left-hand inequality are both elegant and perfectly executed. A flawless submission.",
