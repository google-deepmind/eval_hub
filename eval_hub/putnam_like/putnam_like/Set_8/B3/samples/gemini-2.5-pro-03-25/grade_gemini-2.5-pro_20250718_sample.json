    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. The student first correctly handles the base case n=1. For the general case, the student uses an elegant change of variables for each part of the inequality, transforming the problem into comparing two new integrals. The key inequalities between the arguments of the function are then rigorously proven using calculus. This is an alternative, yet equally valid, method to the one in the rubric. Full points are awarded for a flawless solution.",
