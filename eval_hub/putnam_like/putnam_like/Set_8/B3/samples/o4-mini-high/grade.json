    "comment": "A rerrengement cannot be valid if the function $f$ could attain negative values. Even for positive functions the given condition depends on the convexity. Starting from 'on the other hand' - the inequality there does not hold for $k=n$. For the upper bound there is a mistake: $f(1/n)\\geq f(0)$ is false.",
