    "comment": "The solution proves the two inequalities separately. The proof for the first inequality (lower bound) is fundamentally flawed; it relies on an unsubstantiated claim from majorization theory and contains multiple incorrect steps and logical fallacies. The proof for the second inequality (upper bound) correctly uses Chebyshev's inequality to obtain a key intermediate result, which is a good step. However, the subsequent argument required to complete the proof is incorrect, containing basic errors where inequalities are reversed. The final score reflects credit for the correct application of Chebyshev's inequality but penalizes the numerous significant errors in the rest of the solution.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Unjustified claims (invoking majorization without proof or proper conditions); logical fallacies (drawing conclusions that do not follow from the premises); fundamental errors (repeatedly reversing the direction of inequalities involving a decreasing function); precision errors (equating an integral with a particular Riemann-type sum)."
