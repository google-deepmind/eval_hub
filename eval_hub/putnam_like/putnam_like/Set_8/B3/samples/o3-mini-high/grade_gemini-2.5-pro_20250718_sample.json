    "comment": "The solution attempts a creative probabilistic approach. However, the proof is fundamentally flawed as it relies on a central inequality, $f(1-1/n) \\le n\\int_0^1 x^{n-1}f(x)dx \\le f(1/n)$, which is demonstrably false (e.g., for f(x)=1-x). The purported derivation of this key inequality contains multiple significant errors, including an unproven assertion about quantiles and a false claim about the inequality $(1/n)^{1/n} \\le 1/n$. Although some minor, isolated steps are correct, the core logical structure of the proof is invalid, rendering the conclusion unsupported.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Fundamental logical error: The proof is based on a key intermediate inequality that is false. The argument used to justify this inequality contains additional unproven assertions, calculation errors, and further logical flaws."
