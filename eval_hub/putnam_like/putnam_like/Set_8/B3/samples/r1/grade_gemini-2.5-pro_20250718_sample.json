    "comment": "The student provides a very elegant and correct proof for the right-hand inequality (the upper bound) using a change of variables and the valid inequality $t^{1/n} \\geq t/n$. This part earns full marks. However, the proof for the left-hand inequality (the lower bound) is based on the claim that $t^{1/n} \\leq 1 - t/n$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, which is false (e.g., for t=1, it implies $1 \\leq 1-1/n$). This invalidates the entire argument for the lower bound, resulting in no points for that part.",
