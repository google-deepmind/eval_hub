    "comment": "An excellent and creative solution using an alternative method (stochastic dominance). The core mathematical steps \u2014 defining random variables, calculating their CDFs, and proving the required inequalities between them \u2014 are all correct. A point was deducted for a conceptual error in stating the resulting dominance relationships, even though the final conclusion was derived correctly from the established CDF inequalities.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual error: The solution correctly proves the required inequalities between the cumulative distribution functions (e.g., F_X \u2264 F_Y) but then incorrectly states the resulting stochastic dominance relationships (i.e., it claims X dominates Y, when in fact Y dominates X)."
