    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly identifies the set Y as the open interval (0, c^3). The supremum and infimum are correctly identified and proven by constructing appropriate families of sequences. The argument for surjectivity onto the interval (0, c^3) is rigorous, using a well-chosen family of geometric sequences and a correct application of the Intermediate Value Theorem. The presentation is clear and logical.",
