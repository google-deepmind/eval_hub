    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly identifies the set as the open interval (0, c^3). The proof follows a logical and complete path that is different from the rubric's but equally valid: it establishes the bounds, shows that the endpoints of the interval are the infimum and supremum of the set, and rigorously proves that the set is an interval using a convexity argument and the Intermediate Value Theorem. The justification for the continuity of the sum function via the Weierstrass M-test is particularly well-done.",
