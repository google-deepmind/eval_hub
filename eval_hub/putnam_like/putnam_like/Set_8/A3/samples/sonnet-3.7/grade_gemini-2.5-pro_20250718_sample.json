    "comment": "The student correctly identified the supremum ($c^3$) and infimum (0) of the set Y. The use of a geometric sequence to show that the sum of cubes can be arbitrarily close to 0 is also correct. However, there are significant errors. The primary mistake is misinterpreting the 'positive reals' condition, leading to the incorrect conclusion that $c^3$ is an attainable maximum and the set is $(0, c^3]$. Secondly, the proof for showing all intermediate values are attained is flawed, as it relies on a convex combination with a sequence that is not in the set X. Partial credit is awarded for correctly identifying the bounds of the set and for the calculations involving the geometric series.",
