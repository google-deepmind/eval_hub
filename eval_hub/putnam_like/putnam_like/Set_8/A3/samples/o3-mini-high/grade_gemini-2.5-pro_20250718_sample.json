    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the resulting set Y and provides good intuition for why its infimum is 0 and its supremum is c^3. The reformulation of the problem in terms of a probability distribution is a nice touch. However, the solution contains a major logical flaw: it fails to prove that all intermediate values in the interval (0, c^3) can be achieved. The argument only establishes the bounds of the set Y, not that Y is a connected interval, which is the main part of the proof. The arguments for the bounds themselves are also informal and lack the rigor expected in a competition.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Gap: The proof incorrectly assumes that because the set's infimum is 0 and its supremum is c^3, the set must be the entire interval (0, c^3). Lack of Rigor: The arguments for achieving values arbitrarily close to the endpoints are hand-wavy and do not provide explicit, valid sequence constructions."
