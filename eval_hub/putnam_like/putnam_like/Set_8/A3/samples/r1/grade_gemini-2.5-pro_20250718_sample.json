    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the resulting set Y as the open interval (0, c^3) and provides a conceptually sound, albeit informal, argument for why 0 and c^3 are the infimum and supremum. However, the solution completely fails to prove that the set Y is connected, i.e., that all values between the infimum and supremum are actually attained. This is a critical omission, as proving this surjectivity is the core of the problem.",
