    "comment": "The student correctly establishes that the set of values Y is a subset of (0, c^3) and correctly proves that the infimum and supremum of Y are 0 and c^3, respectively, using well-chosen families of sequences. The derivation for the sum of cubes of a geometric sequence is also correct. However, the main argument to prove that Y covers the entire interval (i.e., that it is connected) is critically flawed. It presumes the result for a sum of c-a to prove the result for c, which is a form of circular reasoning. A simpler approach would have been to analyze the range of the function of r obtained from the geometric series, which would have completed the proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical error (circular reasoning by assuming the result for a subproblem)."
