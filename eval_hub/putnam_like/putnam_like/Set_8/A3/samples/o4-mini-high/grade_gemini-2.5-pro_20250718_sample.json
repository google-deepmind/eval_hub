    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the set as the interval (0, c^3) and provides a correct argument for why the set of sums Y must be a subset of (0, c^3). This corresponds to the first step of the rubric (2 points). However, the solution fails to demonstrate that all values within this interval are achievable. The student's approach is to find the infimum and supremum of Y and then conclude that Y is the open interval between them. This approach has two main issues: 1) It implicitly and without justification assumes that the set Y is an interval (a consequence of the connectivity of the domain X). 2) The example sequences used to demonstrate the infimum and supremum have only a finite number of non-zero terms, which violates the problem's condition that the sequences consist of positive reals (x_n > 0 for all n). The main part of the proof, showing that any value in (0, c^3) can be realized, is missing. Some credit (2 points) is given for the insight of identifying the correct infimum and supremum.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap (the argument that the set is an interval is incomplete, missing a connectivity argument). Factual error (the provided example sequences do not satisfy the condition that all terms must be strictly positive)."
