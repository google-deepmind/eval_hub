    "comment": "The solution is well-reasoned, logically structured, and internally consistent. However, it is based on a misinterpretation of the problem's initial conditions. The student assumes each box initially contains one ball for each number from 1 to m. The rubric implies that each box initially contains k balls of number k, for k=1 to m. This fundamental difference in interpretation leads to a different (and algebraically simpler) problem being solved. The student's inductive proof for the invariance of the expected value is elegant but does not match the rubric's first step, which proves the invariance of probability, thus earning partial credit. The solution correctly derives the final condition for m based on its calculated expected value, earning credit for that step. However, it completely omits the intermediate step of finding the probability distribution of the final outcome.",
