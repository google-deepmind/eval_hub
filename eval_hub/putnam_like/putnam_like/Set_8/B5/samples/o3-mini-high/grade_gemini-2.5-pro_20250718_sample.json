    "comment": "The student correctly calculates the initial expected value as (2m+1)/3 and correctly deduces the final condition m\u22611 (mod 3). The solution's strategy relies on the key insight that the expectation remains invariant through the process of transferring balls. However, this central claim is asserted without proof ('A short calculation shows...'), which constitutes a significant logical gap. The rubric allocates 4 points for a formal proof of this invariance, so a substantial deduction is warranted for this omission. The rest of the calculations and reasoning are flawless.",
