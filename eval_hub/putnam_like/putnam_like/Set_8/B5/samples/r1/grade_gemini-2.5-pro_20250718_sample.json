    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one in the rubric, it is a valid and arguably more elegant alternative using the law of total expectation. The student correctly calculates the initial expected value, demonstrates that this expectation remains invariant throughout the process, and correctly derives the condition on m. The solution is flawless.",
