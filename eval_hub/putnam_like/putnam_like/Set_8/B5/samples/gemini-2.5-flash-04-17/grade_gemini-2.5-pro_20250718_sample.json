    "comment": "The student presents a complete and correct solution. Instead of the coloring argument suggested by the rubric, the student uses a more direct and equally valid method by setting up and solving a recurrence relation for the expected value. The derivation is clear, the calculations are accurate, and the final condition on m is correctly identified. The solution demonstrates a strong understanding of expectation and recurrence relations.",
