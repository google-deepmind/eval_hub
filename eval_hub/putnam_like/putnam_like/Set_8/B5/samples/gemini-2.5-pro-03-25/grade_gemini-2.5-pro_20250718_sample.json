    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. Although the method (using conditional expectation and a recurrence relation for the expected value) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (using a probability symmetry argument), it is a perfectly valid and well-executed alternative. The student correctly sets up the problem, derives the recurrence, proves by induction that the expected value is constant for every draw, and correctly calculates this value to be (2m+1)/3. The final condition on m is derived correctly. The solution is flawless.",
