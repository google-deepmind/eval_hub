    "comment": "The student presents a valid and elegant alternative solution by comparison with an integral of a logarithm. The main part of the argument, which shows that the comparison integral diverges via a telescoping sum argument, is correct and well-executed. However, the initial derivation of the key inequality relating the original integrand to the logarithm contains a significant logical error involving an inequality between fractions. While the final inequality used for comparison is correct, the flawed reasoning to obtain it warrants a deduction.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical error in an inequality. The solution incorrectly reasons that because f(x) > f(x+\u03b1), then (f(x)-f(x+\u03b1))/f(x) >= (f(x)-f(x+\u03b1))/f(x+\u03b1). For positive quantities, decreasing the denominator increases the fraction, so the inequality should be reversed. This invalidates the specific path taken to establish the lower bound for the integrand."
