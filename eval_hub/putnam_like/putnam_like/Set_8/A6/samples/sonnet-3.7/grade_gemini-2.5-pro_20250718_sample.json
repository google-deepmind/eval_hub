    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. Although the method differs entirely from the one outlined in the rubric, the argument is logically sound, rigorous, and fully justifies the result. The student cleverly introduces the function h(x) = -log(f(x)) and uses properties of the exponential function to establish a valid lower bound for the integral. The subsequent proof that this lower-bound integral diverges is executed perfectly. In a competition setting, a correct and complete alternative solution merits full credit.",
