    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof. Although the method is different from the one outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The argument correctly reduces the integral to a series, finds a suitable lower bound using inequalities and a telescoping sum, and then proves the divergence of this lower bound by correctly relating the divergence of a sum to the convergence of an infinite product to zero. The solution is flawless.",
