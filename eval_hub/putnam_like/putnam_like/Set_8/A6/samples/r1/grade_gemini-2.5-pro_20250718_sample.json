    "comment": "The initial substitution and subsequent decomposition of the integral into two parts (K and L) are correct and show good algebraic manipulation. However, the core of the argument is not a valid proof; it merely checks a few specific cases of functions (e.g., polynomial, exponential). This 'proof by example' is a fundamental logical flaw, as it fails to establish the result for all functions satisfying the given criteria. The solution does not contain any of the key steps or ideas from the provided rubric, such as the bounding inequality or the proof by contradiction.",
