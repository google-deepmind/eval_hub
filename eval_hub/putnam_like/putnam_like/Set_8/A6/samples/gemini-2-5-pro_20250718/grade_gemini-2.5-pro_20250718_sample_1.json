    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and rigorous proof. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the grading rubric, it is a valid and well-executed alternative approach. The student successfully bounds the integral by a divergent series, using careful estimates and a standard argument involving a telescoping sum of logarithms to prove the series divergence. The entire argument is sound.",
