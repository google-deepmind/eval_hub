    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant alternative solution. The approach of establishing a lower bound for the integral via a divergent series is valid and well-executed. The argument relies on correctly bounding the integrand on intervals of length \u03b1 and then proving the resulting series diverges by relating it to an infinite product that converges to zero. The solution is rigorous and demonstrates a strong understanding of the relevant concepts.",
