    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. Although the method used is different from the one suggested in the rubric, it is a valid and well-executed alternative approach to this type of Diophantine approximation problem. The argument, which relies on the fact that $|3a^2-b^2|$ is a non-zero integer, is logically sound and all steps are correctly justified.",
