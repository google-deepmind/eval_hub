    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The proof is rigorous and well-argued. While it employs a different method (using the Mean Value Theorem and the minimal polynomial of 1/sqrt(3)) than the contradiction-based approach in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and elegant alternative. All steps are logically sound, leading to the correct conclusion. Full marks are awarded.",
