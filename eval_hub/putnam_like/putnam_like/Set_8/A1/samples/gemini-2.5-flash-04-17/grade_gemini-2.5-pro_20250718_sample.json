    "comment": "The student provided a complete and rigorous proof that is mathematically sound. Although the method (a direct proof) differs from the proof by contradiction outlined in the rubric, it is a valid alternative approach that demonstrates full understanding of the core concepts, such as using the integrality and non-zero nature of the expression $3a^2-b^2$. The argument is well-structured and all algebraic steps are logically correct. Therefore, the solution is awarded full marks.",
