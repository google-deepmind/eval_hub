    "comment": "The solution presents a valid direct proof, which is a correct alternative to the proof by contradiction outlined in the rubric. The key number-theoretic insight that |3a^2 - b^2| is a non-zero integer (and thus >= 1) is correctly identified and skillfully used to establish a lower bound. However, there is a significant algebraic error in the initial step of rearranging the inequality. The target inequality was incorrectly transformed, leading the student to prove a weaker result than the one required. The logical steps following this error are sound, but they are applied to an incorrect premise, which prevents the award of full marks.",
