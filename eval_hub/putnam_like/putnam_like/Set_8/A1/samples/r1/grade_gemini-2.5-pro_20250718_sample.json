    "comment": "The solution presents a valid and elegant proof by contradiction. The main line of reasoning, which involves bounding the integer quantity |3a^2-b^2| to be less than 1, is correct and well-executed. In fact, the bound derived is tighter than the one suggested in the rubric. However, the solution contains a significant logical error in an intermediate step, where a flawed argument about integer and irrational parts of an inequality is presented. Although this erroneous path was ultimately abandoned for a correct one, the presence of a notable logical flaw warrants a deduction.",
