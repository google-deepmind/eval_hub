    "comment": "The student presents a proof using a direct method, which is a valid alternative to the contradiction method suggested in the rubric. However, the proof has two major flaws. First, the student's argument is based on analyzing the quantity $|a^2-3b^2|$, which relates to approximating $\\sqrt{3}$ by $a/b$, not $1/\\sqrt{3}$. The correct integer to consider for this problem is $3a^2-b^2$. Second, the student derives a bound for $|a-b\\sqrt{3}|$ but then incorrectly uses it in Step 4 as a bound for the different quantity $|a\\sqrt{3}-b|$. These fundamental errors invalidate the entire argument, despite the student demonstrating knowledge of some correct techniques.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual error (analyzing the wrong approximation), logical fallacy (incorrect substitution of unequal quantities)."
