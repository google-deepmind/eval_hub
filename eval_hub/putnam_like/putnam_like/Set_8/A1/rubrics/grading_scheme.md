Assume, by contradiction, that
$$
\left|q-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right| \leq \frac{1}{9b^2}.
$$
Then
$$
\left|q^2-\frac{1}{{3}}\right| = \left|q-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right|\left|q+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right| \leq \frac{1}{9b^2}\left|q+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right| \leq \frac{2}{9b^2}.
$$

This step is worth 5 points.
Multiplying the above by $3b^2$ we have
$$
|3a^2-b^2| \leq \frac{2}{3}
$$
and hence $3a^2=b^2$, since they are integers. This shows that $\left| q \right|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, which is a contradiction, since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ is irrational. Finally, the initial assumption was incorrect and hence $\left|q-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right| > \frac{1}{9b^2}.$
