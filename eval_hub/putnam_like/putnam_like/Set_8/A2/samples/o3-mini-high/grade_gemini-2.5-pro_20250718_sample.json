    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method (using gradients of the general conic equation) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (using a specific form for a parabola), the key logical steps are equivalent and valid. The student correctly sets up tangency conditions, solves for the coefficients, correctly identifies and discards the degenerate case (a double line), and arrives at the correct final equation for the parabola. The solution is flawless and well-explained.",
