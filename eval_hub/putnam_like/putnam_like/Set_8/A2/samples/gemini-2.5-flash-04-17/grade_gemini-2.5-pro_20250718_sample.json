    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The method used, based on the general equation of a conic tangent to two lines, is different from the one in the rubric but is perfectly valid and elegant. The derivation is clear, the condition for the conic to be a parabola is correctly applied, the degenerate case is properly identified and rejected, and the final answer is correct and thoroughly verified. The solution is flawless.",
