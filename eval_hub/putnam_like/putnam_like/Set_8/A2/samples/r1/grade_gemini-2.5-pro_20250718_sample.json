    "comment": "The student's solution provides a correct verification for an equation that satisfies the problem's conditions. However, the grading rubric awards points for a specific derivation method. As the solution does not contain any of the required derivation steps (setting up the general form, solving for coefficients, and analyzing cases), no points can be awarded based on the provided rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological error: The solution consists of a verification rather than the derivation required by the grading scheme."
