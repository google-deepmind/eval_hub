    "comment": "The student provided a correct equation for the parabola and successfully verified that it meets the specified conditions using calculus and a parametric representation. However, the solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric, which requires a derivation from the general form of a conic. Points were awarded for correctly handling the tangency conditions (4/4) and for the correct final answer (1/1). No points were given for deriving the parameters or analyzing cases as these steps from the rubric were not performed.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation: The solution uses a 'state and verify' approach rather than deriving the result from general principles as outlined in the rubric. Incompleteness: The solution does not consider or rule out other possible solutions or degenerate cases."
