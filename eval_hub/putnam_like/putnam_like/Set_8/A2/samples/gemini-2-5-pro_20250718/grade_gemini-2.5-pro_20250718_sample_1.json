    "comment": "The solution is excellent and arrives at the correct equation using a clear and valid method. The derivation of the coefficients from the tangency conditions is flawless. One point was deducted because the solution did not explicitly analyze the two possible sign choices for the xy-term's coefficient and show that one choice leads to a degenerate conic (a line), which was a specific step required by the rubric for full marks. Nevertheless, the submitted work is mathematically superior to the flawed rubric.",
