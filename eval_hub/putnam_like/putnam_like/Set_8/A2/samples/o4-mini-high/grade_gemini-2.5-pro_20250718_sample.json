    "comment": "The solution correctly sets up the problem using the general form of a conic and correctly derives the relationships between the coefficients, corresponding to the first 7 points of the rubric. However, a calculation error (an incorrect sign on the linear y-term) occurs when constructing the equation for one of the two possible parabolas. This error leads the student to mistakenly believe the equation represents a degenerate double line. Based on this, the student incorrectly concludes that no non-degenerate solution exists and fails to provide the required final equation, thus missing the points for the final steps.",
