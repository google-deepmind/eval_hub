    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution using two different valid methods. The final answer is mathematically correct. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric and the final answer does not match the one in the key, the discrepancy is due to a flaw in the rubric itself. The rubric's proposed answer represents a degenerate conic (a line), while the student has correctly identified the equation of the non-degenerate parabola. The solution demonstrates a full understanding of the problem.",
