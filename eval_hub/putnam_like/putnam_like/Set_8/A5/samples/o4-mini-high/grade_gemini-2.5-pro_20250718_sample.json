    "comment": "The solution is flawless and elegant. The student correctly expands the product of cosines using complex exponentials, a valid alternative to the method in the rubric. They correctly relate the integral to the number of ways a sum can be zero, and use a clear parity argument to show that the integral is zero for all odd n. This correctly leads to the conclusion that the liminf is 0. All steps required by the rubric are present and fully justified.",
