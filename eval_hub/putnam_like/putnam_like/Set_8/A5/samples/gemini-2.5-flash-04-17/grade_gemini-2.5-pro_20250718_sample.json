    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem. The student correctly reformulates the integral using complex exponentials, a valid alternative to the sum-of-cosines approach. The problem is successfully reduced to a combinatorial counting problem, and the key insight that the integral is zero for all odd n is clearly identified and proven using a parity argument. The final conclusion that the liminf is zero is correct and well-justified. The student even correctly shows that the limit of the sequence is zero, a stronger result that implies the answer.",
