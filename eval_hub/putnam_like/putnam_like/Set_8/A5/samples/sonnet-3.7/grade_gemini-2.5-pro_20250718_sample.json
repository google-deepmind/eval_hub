    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It follows a logical path equivalent to the one in the rubric. The use of complex exponentials is a valid and efficient way to expand the product of cosines. The key insight that the integral vanishes for odd $n$ is clearly explained, and this fact is correctly used to determine the limit inferior. The solution is complete and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem.",
