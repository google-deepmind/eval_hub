    "comment": "The solution is exemplary. The student correctly uses complex exponentials to expand the product of cosines, correctly identifies that the integral depends on the number of ways a weighted sum of signs is zero, and correctly proves this number is zero for all odd n using a clear parity argument. The final conclusion about the limit inferior is rigorously justified. An alternative symmetry argument was also provided, demonstrating a deep understanding of the material.",
