    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem. The student uses a valid and efficient method based on Euler's formula to expand the product into a sum of complex exponentials. The subsequent integration and analysis are flawless. The argument for why the integral is zero for odd values of n is well-reasoned and correct. The final conclusion about the limit infimum is properly justified.",
