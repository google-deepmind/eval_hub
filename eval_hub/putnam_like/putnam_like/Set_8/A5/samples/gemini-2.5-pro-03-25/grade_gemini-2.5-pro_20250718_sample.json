    "comment": "The solution is flawless and demonstrates a strong understanding of the concepts. The student correctly uses complex exponentials to represent the product of cosines, correctly evaluates the integral, and provides a clear and rigorous argument based on parity to show that the integral is zero for all odd n. The final conclusion about the limit inferior is well-reasoned and correct. The method used is an excellent alternative to the one outlined in the rubric.",
