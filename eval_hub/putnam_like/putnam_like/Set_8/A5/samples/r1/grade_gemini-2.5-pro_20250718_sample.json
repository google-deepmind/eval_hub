    "comment": "The solution is excellent and complete. The student correctly uses Fourier series to relate the integral to the number of solutions of a specific sum, which is a valid alternative to the method in the rubric. The key step of proving the integral is zero for all odd n is correctly identified and explained. The conclusion that the liminf is zero follows logically and is well-supported. The argument is flawless.",
