While the approach taken (using the Law of Total Expectation directly) differs from the one outlined in the rubric (calculating P(N=n) first), it is a perfectly valid and more direct method. The student correctly identified the conditional expectation E[N|P=p] = 1/p and then correctly calculated its expectation E[1/P] by evaluating the improper integral \u222b(1/p)dp over [0,1], correctly showing it diverges to infinity. All key concepts were demonstrated with mastery.",
