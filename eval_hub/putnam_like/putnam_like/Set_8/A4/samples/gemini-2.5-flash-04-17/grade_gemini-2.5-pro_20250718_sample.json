    "comment": "The student provides two complete and correct proofs. The second proof aligns perfectly with the steps in the rubric, correctly deriving the unconditional probability mass function and then calculating the expectation from its definition, showing the resulting series diverges. The first proof using the law of total expectation is also a valid and elegant alternative. The solution is flawless and demonstrates a deep understanding of the concepts.",
