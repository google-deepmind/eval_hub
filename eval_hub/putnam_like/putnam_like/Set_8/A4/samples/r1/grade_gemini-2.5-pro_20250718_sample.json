    "comment": "The student provides a correct and elegant solution using the law of total expectation. All steps are logically sound and well-executed: the conditional expectation E[N|p] is correctly identified, the integral for the unconditional expectation is set up correctly, and the improper integral is evaluated flawlessly to show it diverges to infinity. Although this method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and more direct approach, demonstrating a full understanding of the required concepts. The solution is awarded full marks.",
