    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student provides two distinct, correct, and elegant proofs for the statement. The first proof uses the law of total expectation, and the second uses the tail-sum formula for expectation. Both methods are executed flawlessly and demonstrate a strong command of the relevant probability theory, even though they follow a different path from the one suggested in the rubric. The final conclusion is well-supported in both cases.",
