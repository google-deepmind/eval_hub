    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly applies a suitable substitution to transform the functional equation. The differentiation with respect to the new parameter is carried out meticulously and without error. The resulting ordinary differential equation, f''(x)=0, is correctly identified and solved. The final step of verifying that the family of solutions f(x)=Ax+B works for all A, B is also performed correctly. The entire argument is logical, clear, and complete.",
