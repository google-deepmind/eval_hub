    "comment": "The student presents a well-structured solution. The change of variables is appropriate, and the derivation correctly leads to the differential equation f''(x) = 0 and the final solution f(x) = Ax+B. The verification is also correct. However, the core of the argument relies on Taylor series expansions that assume the existence of third and fourth derivatives (f''' and f''''). The problem only guarantees f is twice differentiable. The solution does not justify why f is smooth enough for this method to be valid, which is a significant gap in rigor and was a point-earning step in the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Lack of Rigor: The solution assumes without proof that the function f possesses higher-order derivatives than what is given in the problem statement, which is necessary for the Taylor expansion method used."
