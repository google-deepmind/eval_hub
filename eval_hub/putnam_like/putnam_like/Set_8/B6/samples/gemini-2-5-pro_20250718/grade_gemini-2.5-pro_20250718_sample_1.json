    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. The initial testing of simple functions is a good starting point. The main argument uses a valid alternative method (limit definition of the second derivative) instead of the variable substitution suggested in the rubric. This method is executed flawlessly, including a crucial justification for the continuity of f''. The final derivation of the differential equation, its solution, and the verification step are all correct. The solution is exceptionally clear and well-structured, deserving of full marks.",
