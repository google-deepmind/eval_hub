    "comment": "The student presents a clever and largely correct proof by differentiating the functional equation with respect to one variable while holding the other constant. The overall strategy is sound and leads to the correct family of solutions. However, the proof implicitly assumes the existence of the third derivative, f'''(x), which is not given in the problem statement. This assumption must be justified from the properties of the equation itself, and this crucial logical step was omitted, preventing a perfect score. The remainder of the argument, including the final verification, is well-executed.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap: The solution assumes the existence of the third derivative (f''') without providing the necessary justification."
