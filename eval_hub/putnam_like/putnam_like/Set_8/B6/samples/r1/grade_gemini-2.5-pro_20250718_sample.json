    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the final form of the solution, $f(x) = Cx+D$. The method of using a Taylor series expansion is a valid approach and leads to a correct functional equation for $f''$. However, the solution has major logical gaps. Firstly, the derivation of the equation for $f''$ relies on an approximation by truncating the Taylor series, which is not rigorous without a limiting argument. Secondly, the solution to this resulting functional equation for $f''$ is asserted without any proof, which is a critical step in the argument. Due to these significant flaws in the proof's core logic, the score is substantially reduced.",
