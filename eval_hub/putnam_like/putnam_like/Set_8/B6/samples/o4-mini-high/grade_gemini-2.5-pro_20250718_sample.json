    "comment": "An elegant solution using Taylor series. The main argument, which shows $f''(a)=0$ by comparing the $h^2$ coefficients, is correct and well-executed. However, a perfect score was not awarded due to two issues: first, the solution implicitly assumes $f$ is three times differentiable without justification (a required step for this method); second, it contains a calculation error in the $h^3$ term of the left-hand side's expansion. Despite these flaws, the core of the argument is sound and leads to the correct set of solutions.",
