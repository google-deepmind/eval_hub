    "comment": "The solution is exemplary. The student correctly identifies an effective change of variables, transforming the original equation into an identity. The method of defining a function $F(t)$ and differentiating it twice with respect to the new parameter $t$ is powerful and executed flawlessly. The calculations are accurate, and the logical progression from the resulting differential equation $f''(x)=0$ to the final family of linear solutions is clear and correct. The final verification step confirms the result. The entire solution is rigorous, well-organized, and complete.",
