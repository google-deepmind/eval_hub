    "comment": "The solution is logically sound and complete. The student correctly reformulates the problem by considering the function f(x) = (ln x)/x, analyzes its monotonicity using the derivative, and applies this analysis to the given values of a and b by correctly establishing that a > e for the given range of n. The reasoning is clear and leads to the correct conclusion.",
