    "comment": "The solution is correct and well-argued. The student correctly reformulates the problem as an inequality involving logarithms, which leads to analyzing the monotonicity of a function. The chosen auxiliary function, f(x) = (ln x)/x^(1/3), is different from the one suggested in the rubric (g(x) = (ln x)/x), but it is perfectly valid and handled flawlessly. The derivative is calculated correctly, the interval of decrease is identified, and this is applied correctly to the given range of n to reach the final, correct conclusion. The solution is complete and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem.",
