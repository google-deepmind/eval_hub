    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly transforms the problem using logarithms and then uses calculus to analyze the monotonicity of a relevant function. The chosen function, f(x) = (ln x)/x^(1/3), is different from the one in the rubric, but the method is equally valid and executed perfectly. The student correctly identifies the critical value x=e^3 and shows that for n>=21, the function is decreasing, leading to the correct conclusion.",
