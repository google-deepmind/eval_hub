    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly identifies the standard approach of analyzing the function f(x) = (ln x)/x. The argument is clear, logical, and every step is well-justified. The student correctly calculates the derivative, finds the region where the function is decreasing, and correctly establishes that for the given range of n, both a and b fall into this region. The conclusion is derived flawlessly.",
