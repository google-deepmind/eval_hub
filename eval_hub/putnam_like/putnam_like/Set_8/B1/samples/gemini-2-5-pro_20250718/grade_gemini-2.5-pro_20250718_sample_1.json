    "comment": "The solution is flawless and exceptionally well-explained. It correctly reframes the problem by analyzing the function f(x) = (ln x)/x, finds its derivative to determine its monotonicity, and applies this to the specific values of a and b by correctly establishing that a > e for n >= 21. The logical flow is clear, complete, and earns full marks.",
