Solution step (4 points):
$a^b = e^{b\ln a}$ and $b^a = e^{a\ln b}$, so it suffices to compare $a\ln b$ and $b\ln a$. Observe also that
$$
a\ln b < b\ln a,\qquad \text{iff} \qquad \frac{\ln b}{b} < \frac{\ln a}{a}.
$$

Solution step (4 points):
Consider a function $f(x)=\frac{\ln x}{x}$ for $x>0$. Obviously $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{\ln x}{x^2}$. We see that $f'(x)>0$ for $x<e$ and $f'(x)<0$ for $x>e$. Therefore for $e<a<b$ we have $a\ln b < b\ln a$.

Solution step (2 points):
Observe that $e^3<\left(\frac{11}4\right)^3<21$. Hence for $n\geq 21$ we have $a^b>b^a$.
