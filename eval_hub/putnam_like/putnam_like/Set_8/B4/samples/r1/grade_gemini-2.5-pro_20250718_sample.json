    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies that the problem reduces to finding the distribution of a ratio of two independent standard exponential variables. The probability density function is correctly stated, and the final probability is correctly calculated by integrating over the appropriate intervals and summing the resulting series, which is correctly identified as the alternating harmonic series for ln(2).",
