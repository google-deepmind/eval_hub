    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the transformation to exponential random variables and correctly calculates the final probability by summing the relevant integrals. The final sum is correctly identified as the series for ln(2). Points were deducted because the probability density function for the ratio of two i.i.d. exponential random variables was stated as a known fact without the derivation, which was an expected part of the solution according to the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of a required derivation."
