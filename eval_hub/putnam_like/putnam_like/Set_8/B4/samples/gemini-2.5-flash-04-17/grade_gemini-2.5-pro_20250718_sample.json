    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly transforms the random variables into exponential distributions and provides a full derivation. The calculation of the probability for each integer part is done correctly via direct integration, which is a valid alternative to finding the density of the ratio first. The final step of summing the series and identifying it as ln(2) is also perfect. An exemplary solution.",
