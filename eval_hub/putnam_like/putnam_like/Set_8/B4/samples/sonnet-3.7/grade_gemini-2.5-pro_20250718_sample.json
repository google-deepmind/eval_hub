    "comment": "The solution is completely correct and well-explained. The student uses a direct geometric approach by setting up inequalities on X and Y, which is a valid and elegant alternative to the change-of-variable method suggested in the rubric. The student correctly calculates the probability for each component of the event and correctly sums the resulting infinite series to arrive at the final answer, ln(2).",
