    "comment": "The solution is very well-structured and almost entirely correct. The student correctly transforms the random variables into i.i.d. exponential variables, finds the correct probability density function for their ratio, and sets up the proper sum of integrals to find the final probability. The final answer of ln(2) is correct. A single point was deducted for an error in reasoning in the final step: the series was incorrectly identified as 'telescoping', while it is actually the alternating harmonic series whose value is a well-known result from the Taylor expansion of ln(1+x).",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Minor conceptual error: The student incorrectly identified the final infinite series as a 'telescoping series'."
