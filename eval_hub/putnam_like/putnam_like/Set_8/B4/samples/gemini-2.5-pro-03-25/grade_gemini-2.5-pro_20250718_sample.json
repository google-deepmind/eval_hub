    "comment": "The solution is entirely correct and well-explained. The student provides a clear and rigorous derivation of the probability for each integer value by correctly setting up and evaluating the double integral over the appropriate region. The final step, summing the probabilities for all even integers and identifying the resulting series as ln(2), is also flawless. The inclusion of an alternative verification method using exponential distributions further demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem.",
