    "comment": "The solution is flawless and exceptionally well-presented. The student correctly identifies the distribution of Z=ln(X)/ln(Y) (either directly through integration on the unit square or by transforming to exponential variables) and then correctly calculates the probability by summing over the appropriate intervals. The final summation is correctly identified as the series for ln(2). The inclusion of two distinct, complete, and correct methods is commendable.",
