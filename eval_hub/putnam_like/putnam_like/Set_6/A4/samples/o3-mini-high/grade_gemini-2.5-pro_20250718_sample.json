    "comment": "The student provides a fully correct and insightful solution. Instead of the induction suggested in the rubric, the student correctly derives the recurrence relations for the ratios $r_n = a_{n+1}/a_n$ and identifies this structure as a traversal of the Calkin-Wilf tree. Citing the known property of this tree\u2014that it contains every positive rational number exactly once\u2014is a valid and efficient way to prove that the set S is the set of all positive rational numbers. The solution is well-reasoned and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic.",
