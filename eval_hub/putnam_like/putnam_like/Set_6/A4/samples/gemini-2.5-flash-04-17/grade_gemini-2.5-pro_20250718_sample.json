    "comment": "The student presents a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and insightful alternative. The student correctly derives recurrence relations for the ratio r_n, connects these to transformations on coprime integer pairs (p,q), and correctly identifies that this process generates all positive rational numbers by relating it to the Stern-Brocot or Calkin-Wilf tree structure. The reasoning is clear, the calculations are accurate, and the final conclusion is correct. The solution demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem.",
