    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly derives the recurrence relations for the ratios $r_n = a_{n+1}/a_n$. They then correctly identify that this sequence generates all positive rational numbers and provide a clear and complete proof by induction on the sum of the numerator and denominator. The argument is flawless and leads to the correct conclusion. The proof structure is equivalent to the one suggested in the rubric and is perfectly valid.",
