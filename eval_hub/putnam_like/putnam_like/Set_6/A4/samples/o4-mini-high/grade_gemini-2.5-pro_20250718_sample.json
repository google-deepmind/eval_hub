    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the two generating functions for the ratios ($f(x)=x+1$ and $g(x)=x/(x+1)$) and provides a correct argument that repeated application of these functions starting from 1 generates all positive rational numbers. The final conclusion is correct. However, the derivation for how the second function arises from the sequence's recurrence relations is flawed. The student makes an incorrect algebraic assumption (a_k^2 is not equal to a_{k-1}a_{k+1}) and also uses the wrong index in the resulting recurrence. This is a significant error in the proof's logical chain, as it fails to rigorously connect the sequence to the generating process.",
