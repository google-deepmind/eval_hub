Although the method (identifying the sequence of ratios as an enumeration of the Calkin-Wilf tree) is different from the one suggested in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and elegant approach. All steps are clearly explained and logically sound, leading to the correct conclusion. The solution demonstrates a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical structures.",
