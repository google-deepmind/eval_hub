The set \( S \) is the set of all positive rational numbers, \( \mathbb{Q}^+ \).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Sequence Definition:**
   - The sequence \( (a_n) \) is defined recursively:
     - \( a_0 = 1 \), \( a_1 = 1 \).
     - For \( n \geq 1 \):
       - \( a_{2n-1} = a_n + a_{n-1} \),
       - \( a_{2n} = a_n \).

2. **Computing Initial Terms:**
   - Calculating the first few terms reveals:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     a_0 &= 1, \quad a_1 = 1, \\
     a_2 &= a_1 = 1, \\
     a_3 &= a_2 + a_1 = 2, \\
     a_4 &= a_2 = 1, \\
     a_5 &= a_3 + a_2 = 3, \\
     a_6 &= a_3 = 2, \\
     a_7 &= a_4 + a_3 = 3, \\
     &\vdots
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - The sequence begins: \( 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, \ldots \).

3. **Analyzing the Ratios \( r_n = \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \):**
   - Calculating the first few ratios:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     r_0 &= \frac{a_1}{a_0} = 1, \\
     r_1 &= \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 1, \\
     r_2 &= \frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2, \\
     r_3 &= \frac{a_4}{a_3} = \frac{1}{2}, \\
     r_4 &= \frac{a_5}{a_4} = 3, \\
     r_5 &= \frac{a_6}{a_5} = \frac{2}{3}, \\
     &\vdots
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - The ratios include \( 1, 2, \frac{1}{2}, 3, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, 4, \frac{3}{4}, \ldots \).

4. **Connection to the Calkin-Wilf Sequence:**
   - The recurrence relations for \( a_n \) mirror the structure of the **Calkin-Wilf tree**, a binary tree that enumerates all positive rationals exactly once in reduced form.
   - In the Calkin-Wilf sequence:
     - Each left child in the tree is \( \frac{a}{a+b} \),
     - Each right child is \( \frac{a+b}{b} \),
     - The sequence \( r_n = \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \) matches the Calkin-Wilf sequence after the first term.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The ratios \( r_n \) generated by \( \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \) traverse all positive rational numbers in reduced form without repetition.
   - Therefore, the set \( S \) contains every positive rational number exactly once.

**Final Answer:**
The set \( S \) is the set of all positive rational numbers. Thus,

\[
\boxed{S = \mathbb{Q}^+}
\]
