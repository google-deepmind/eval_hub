    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that the set S is the set of all positive rational numbers. The solution also shows a good insight by correctly identifying the connection between the sequence of ratios and the Calkin-Wilf sequence. However, the submission does not constitute a formal proof. It asserts that the sequence generated is the Calkin-Wilf sequence and that this sequence enumerates all positive rationals, but it does not prove either of these non-trivial claims. Furthermore, the solution does not follow the specific inductive proof structure required by the grading rubric, for which the majority of points are awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Proof by assertion; incomplete argument. The core claims of the argument are stated without proof. The solution also fails to adhere to the proof structure specified in the rubric."
