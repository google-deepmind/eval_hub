    "comment": "The student correctly derives the recursive relations for the ratios of consecutive terms ($r \\to r+1$ and $r \\to r/(r+1)$) and reaches the correct final conclusion. However, the solution's methodology diverges substantially from the grading rubric. Instead of providing the required proof by induction, the student identifies the structure as the Calkin-Wilf tree and asserts that it generates all positive rationals without proof. Full points are awarded for the correct conclusion, and partial credit for the main proof step is given for identifying the core algebraic transformations, but points are deducted for omitting the specific inductive framework and proof required by the rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The proof structure does not follow the rubric's guidelines. The argument is incomplete as it relies on citing a known, non-trivial result without providing a self-contained proof."
