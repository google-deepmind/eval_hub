    "comment": "The student presents a creative and alternative approach to the problem, different from the one in the rubric. The initial step, which correctly argues that it's sufficient to only consider sums of terms far out in the sequence (tail-sums) by noting that sums involving any of the first N-1 terms are finite in number, is a valid and useful reduction. This is a solid piece of reasoning. However, the main part of the argument (Step 2) is merely a sketch. It relies on two major, unproven assertions: that the statement holds for sums of 45 terms, and that this 'porous' property is preserved under Minkowski summation. The student simply states that these can be proven without providing any justification, which constitutes a major logical gap. The solution demonstrates some high-level understanding but lacks the required rigorous proof.",
