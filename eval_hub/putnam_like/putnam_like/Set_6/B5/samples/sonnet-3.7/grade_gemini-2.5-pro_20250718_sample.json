    "comment": "The student presents a creative and powerful proof strategy based on a measure-theoretic argument, which is a valid alternative to the inductive approach suggested by the rubric. The core ideas\u2014partitioning the sums and showing their covering has small measure\u2014are excellent. The calculation of the total measure is also correct. However, the proof contains a significant logical flaw in the construction of the covering set for \"Type I\" sums, invalidating the central step of the argument. The solution also omits the preliminary step of reducing the problem to positive intervals, which is connected to the aforementioned flaw.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical Error: The proof incorrectly defines the covering set for a subset of the sums, which invalidates the main inclusion. Omission of Cases: The argument implicitly assumes the interval is positive, and the logic presented fails without this initial reduction."
