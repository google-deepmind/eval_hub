    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof. While the method differs from the one suggested in the rubric, it is a standard and powerful topological approach to this type of problem. The key steps\u2014showing that the set of sums of at most N terms (W_N) is closed, countable, and thus nowhere dense, and then showing that the closure of the set of sums of exactly N terms (S_N) is a subset of W_N\u2014are all executed flawlessly. The argument is logical, well-structured, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the concepts.",
