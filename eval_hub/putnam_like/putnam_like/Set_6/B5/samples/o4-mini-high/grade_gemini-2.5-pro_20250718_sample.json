    "comment": "The solution presents a clear, alternative strategy to the one in the rubric by attempting to show the set of sums has an empty interior. It correctly identifies that sums formed from a finite initial segment of the sequence can be excluded from a subinterval. However, the core of the argument is fatally flawed. The proof incorrectly analyzes the sums that use at least one term r_n with a large index n. It only considers sums with exactly one 'large' index and 2024 'small' indices, completely neglecting all other cases (e.g., sums with two or more 'large' indices). This incomplete case analysis invalidates the final conclusion.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical flaw due to incomplete case analysis. The proof fails to account for all types of sums possible."
