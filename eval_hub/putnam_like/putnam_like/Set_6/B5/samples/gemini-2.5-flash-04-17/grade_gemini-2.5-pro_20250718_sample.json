    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof using a powerful topological argument, which is a valid alternative to the inductive approach suggested in the rubric. The key steps\u2014characterizing the closure of the set of sums as a countable set and deducing that it must be nowhere dense\u2014are well-reasoned and accurate. The solution is elegant and demonstrates a strong command of the relevant mathematical concepts.",
