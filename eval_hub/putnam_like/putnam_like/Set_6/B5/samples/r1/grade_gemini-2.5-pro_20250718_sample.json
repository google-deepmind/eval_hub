    "comment": "The student's argument is based on the premise that because the set of sums S is countable, any interval (a, b) must contain a subinterval disjoint from S. This premise is fundamentally incorrect. For example, the set of rational numbers Q is countable, but any interval in R contains rational numbers. The solution fails to use the crucial condition that r_n -> 0, which is essential to the correct proof. The submitted work does not follow the inductive structure required by the rubric and is based on a major logical error, thus it earns no points.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The solution contains a major logical fallacy by incorrectly claiming that the complement of any countable set must contain an interval. It also omits the use of a critical piece of information from the problem statement (that the sequence tends to zero)."
