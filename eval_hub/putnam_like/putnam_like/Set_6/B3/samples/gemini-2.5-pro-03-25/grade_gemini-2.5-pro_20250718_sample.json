Although the method used (based on Gronwall's inequality) differs from the one outlined in the grading rubric, it is a standard and valid approach to this type of problem. The solution is well-structured, easy to follow, and demonstrates a strong understanding of differential inequalities. Full credit is awarded for a flawless alternative solution.",
