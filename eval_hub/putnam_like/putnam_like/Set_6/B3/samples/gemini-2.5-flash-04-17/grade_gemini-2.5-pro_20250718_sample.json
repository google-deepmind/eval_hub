    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and well-reasoned alternative proof. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a standard and elegant approach using differential inequalities (a form of Gronwall's inequality). The argument is rigorous, flawless, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. All steps are logically sound and clearly explained.",
