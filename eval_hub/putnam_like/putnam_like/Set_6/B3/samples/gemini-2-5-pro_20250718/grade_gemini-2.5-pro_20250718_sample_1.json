    "comment": "The solution is entirely correct and provides a complete, rigorous proof. The method used, which involves defining an auxiliary function h(x) = (f(x)-f(0))^2 and solving the resulting differential inequality using an integrating factor, is a standard and elegant approach (related to Gr\u00f6nwall's inequality). Although this method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a perfectly valid and well-executed alternative. All steps are logically sound and clearly explained, leading to the correct conclusion.",
