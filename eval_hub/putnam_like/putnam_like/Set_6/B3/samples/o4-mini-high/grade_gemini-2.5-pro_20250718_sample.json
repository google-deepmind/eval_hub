    "comment": "The solution presents a valid and elegant alternative approach using an integral inequality (a form of Gronwall's inequality). The overall structure, including the setup with g(x) = f(x)-f(0) and handling the x\u22640 case by reduction, is excellent. However, there is a significant logical gap in the proof for the case x\u22650. The crucial inequality H'(x) \u2264 H(x) is stated without justification. The derivation, which relies on integrating the given inequality, is a non-trivial step and its omission is a major flaw in the proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap / Incomplete justification. A key step in the argument is asserted without proof."
