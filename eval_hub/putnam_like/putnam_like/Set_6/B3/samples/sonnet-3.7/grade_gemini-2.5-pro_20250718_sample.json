    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous proof that is entirely correct. Although the method used (an auxiliary function and a Gronwall-type argument) is different from the one outlined in the grading rubric (contradiction via MVT), it is a standard and elegant approach to this type of problem. The student demonstrates a full understanding of the concepts and executes the proof flawlessly. Therefore, full credit is awarded.",
