    "comment": "The solution is exemplary. It correctly identifies the structure of the problem and provides two complete and rigorous solution paths, one using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus with L'H\u00f4pital's rule, and another using the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. The key step of evaluating the limit of the integrand is performed flawlessly with clear justification. All steps outlined in the rubric are successfully completed.",
