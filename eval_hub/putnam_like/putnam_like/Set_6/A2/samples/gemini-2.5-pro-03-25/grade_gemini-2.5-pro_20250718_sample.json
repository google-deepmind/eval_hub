    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. They correctly evaluate the limit of the integrand to be 'e' using L'Hopital's rule. The student then correctly justifies the final answer using two different, valid methods: one based on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and L'Hopital's Rule, and an alternative using the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals. The reasoning is exceptionally clear, addressing the subtle point of the integrand's continuity at x=0. The solution is flawless.",
