    "comment": "The solution correctly applies the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals to reduce the problem to finding the limit of the integrand. The subsequent calculation of this limit using Taylor series is also correct and well-reasoned. Full credit is awarded for these two major steps (9/9 points). However, the solution omits the initial observation required by the rubric: justifying the applicability of the Mean Value Theorem. The integrand is not defined at x=0, and the solution does not explicitly state that the function has a removable singularity and can be extended to a continuous function on the closed interval [0, k]. This check for continuity is the first step in the rubric and is worth 1 point.",
