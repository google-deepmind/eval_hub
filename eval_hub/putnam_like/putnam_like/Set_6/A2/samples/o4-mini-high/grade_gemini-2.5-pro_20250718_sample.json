    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies that the limit is equivalent to evaluating the integrand at x=0, which is a correct application of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals (or Fundamental Theorem of Calculus). The limit of the integrand is correctly calculated as 'e' using a valid Taylor series expansion, which is a sound alternative to the L'Hopital's Rule suggested in the rubric. The argument is well-structured, clear, and mathematically flawless.",
