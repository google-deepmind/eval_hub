    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The use of L'Hopital's Rule on the integral expression, which is an application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, is a perfectly valid alternative to the Mean Value Theorem approach. The limit of the integrand is calculated correctly and all steps are well-justified. The student even shows an advanced level of care by explicitly addressing the continuity of the integrand at x=0, which is necessary for the rigorous application of the FTC.",
