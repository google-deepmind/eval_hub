    "comment": "The solution is correct and well-reasoned. The limit of the integrand is correctly found using Taylor series, which is a valid alternative to the L'Hopital's rule method shown in the rubric. The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is then properly applied to evaluate the limit of the overall expression. All steps are logically sound and the final answer is correct.",
