    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly identifies the overall limit as an indeterminate form and applies L'H\u00f4pital's rule in conjunction with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This correctly reduces the problem to finding the limit of the integrand. This second limit is also handled perfectly using L'H\u00f4pital's rule. The method is fully rigorous and all steps are correct.",
