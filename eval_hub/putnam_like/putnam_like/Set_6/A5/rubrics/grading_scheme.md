Solution step (3 points):
Note that $(b+1)^3=b^3 + 3b^2 + 3b + 1$, so $(b+1)^3$ in base $b$ is equal to $1331$. Therefore $d^3(b+1)^3$ in base $b$ is equal to $(d^3)(3d^3)(3d^3)(d^3)$ for any $d$ such that $3d^3<b$.

Solution step (5 points):
Let $N$ be a natural number divisible by any $d\in\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ and such that $3n^4+n<N$. Observe that for all $d\in\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ we have $3d^3<\frac{N}{d}-1.$

Solution step (2 points):
Denote $b_d=\frac{N}{d}-1$ for $d\in\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. Observe that $N^3 = d^3(b_d+1)^3$, so in base $b_d$ is equal to $(d^3)(3d^3)(3d^3)(d^3)$ and is a palindrome.
