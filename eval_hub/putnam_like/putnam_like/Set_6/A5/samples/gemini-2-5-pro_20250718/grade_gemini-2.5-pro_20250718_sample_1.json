    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the algebraic structure of a 4-digit palindrome and explores many potential constructions for the required integer. The solution contains the key insight that an integer of the form $(b+1)^3$ is the palindrome $(1,3,3,1)_b$. However, the student does not manage to generalize this idea or construct a single integer that works for n different bases, which is the core of the problem. The various attempts at construction, while demonstrating significant effort, do not lead to a valid proof.",
