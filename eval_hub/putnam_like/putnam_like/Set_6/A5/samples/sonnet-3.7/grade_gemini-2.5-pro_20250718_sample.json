    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the general algebraic form of a 4-digit palindrome. However, the chosen construction `N = T^3 + T` and subsequent analysis are fundamentally flawed. The argument critically fails to ensure that the calculated digit `a_2` is an integer for the claimed range of bases, which invalidates the entire conclusion. As the approach does not contain any of the key insights outlined in the grading rubric and its own method is incorrect, it earns minimal credit.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Conceptual Error; Flawed Proof. The solution ignores a crucial integrality condition and improperly uses a continuous approximation for a discrete problem."
