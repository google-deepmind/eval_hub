    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the general algebraic form of a 4-digit palindrome. However, the proposed proof using the Chinese Remainder Theorem is fundamentally flawed. The argument critically fails to prove that the 'digit' constraints will be satisfied by the construction, which is a major logical gap. The numerical example provided to support the claim is also incorrect and does not work, undermining the entire method. The approach is very different from the provided rubric and is not successfully executed.",
