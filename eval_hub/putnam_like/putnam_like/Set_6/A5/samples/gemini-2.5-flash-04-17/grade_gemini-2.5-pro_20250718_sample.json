    "comment": "The student found a key building block for the solution by identifying that for an appropriate base b, (b+1)^3 is the palindrome (1331)_b. This is a significant insight. However, they were unable to construct a single number that is a palindrome for 'n' distinct bases, which is the main challenge of the problem. The solution consists of several intelligent but ultimately incomplete attempts and does not provide a full proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof. The student's proposed constructions for a general solution are not shown to work for n bases, as they rely on an unproven assumption that one of the digits will be an integer."
