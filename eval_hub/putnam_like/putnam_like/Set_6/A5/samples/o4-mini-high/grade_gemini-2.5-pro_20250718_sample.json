    "comment": "The student correctly reduces the problem of finding a 4-digit palindrome of the form `(1,c,c,1)_b` to finding an integer `N` that satisfies two congruences (`N \u2261 1 mod b`, `N \u2261 0 mod b+1`) and lies within a specific range (`b^3 < N < b^4`). This initial analysis is good. However, the subsequent proof that such an `N` exists for `n` different bases is critically flawed. The constructive method for choosing bases `b_i` makes them grow very rapidly, causing the corresponding ranges for `N` to be disjoint. Therefore, a single integer `N` cannot exist for multiple such bases. Additionally, the application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem is incorrect as the constructed moduli are not pairwise coprime.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Fundamental Conceptual Error: The proposed construction requires a single integer `N` to lie in multiple, disjoint intervals, which is impossible. Incorrect Application of Theorem: The construction of bases for the Chinese Remainder Theorem fails to produce pairwise coprime moduli."
