    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof. The method used is different from the one outlined in the grading rubric, but it is equally valid and rigorous. The student correctly sets up the general conditions for a 4-digit palindrome, then successfully constructs an integer N and a set of n bases for which N is a 4-digit palindrome, and meticulously verifies that all conditions are met for this construction. Therefore, full marks are awarded.",
