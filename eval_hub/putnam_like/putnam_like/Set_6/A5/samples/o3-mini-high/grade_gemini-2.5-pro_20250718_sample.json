    "comment": "The student presents a creative and alternative approach to the problem by constructing an integer `N` that lies in the intersection of `n` specific intervals. The argument correctly establishes that for a sufficiently large starting base `k`, this intersection of intervals is non-empty. However, the proof contains a fatal flaw: it fails to ensure that the digits of `N` are integers for the chosen bases. The solution derives the condition that the middle digits `c` must be in `[0, b-1]`, but overlooks the critical requirement that `c = (N-(b^3+1))/(b^2+b)` must be an integer for each base. This oversight invalidates the final conclusion that any `N` from the intersection would work.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical flaw / Incomplete proof. The core argument is missing a necessary condition (the integrality of the base-b digits), which makes the conclusion incorrect."
