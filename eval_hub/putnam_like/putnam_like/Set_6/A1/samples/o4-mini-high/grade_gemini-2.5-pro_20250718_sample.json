    "comment": "The student's solution is entirely correct and demonstrates a full understanding of the concepts. All steps are logically sound and the calculations are accurate. It should be noted that the provided grading rubric contains an error: for the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0$, Vieta's formula gives $\\alpha\\beta+\\beta\\gamma+\\gamma\\alpha = b$, not $-b$ as the rubric states. This error in the rubric leads to an incorrect calculation for one of the coefficients and an incorrect final answer. The student correctly used the proper formula and, as a result, produced a flawless solution which deserves full marks.",
