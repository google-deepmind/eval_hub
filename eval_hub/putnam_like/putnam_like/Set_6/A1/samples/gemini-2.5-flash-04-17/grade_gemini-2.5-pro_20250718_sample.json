    "comment": "The solution is exemplary. The student correctly applies Vieta's formulas to find the coefficients of the new polynomial. The derivation for each coefficient is clear, logical, and arithmetically correct. The final answer is correct. The inclusion of a second, alternative method (transformation of variables) further demonstrates a strong command of the material.",
