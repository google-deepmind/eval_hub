    "comment": "The student provides a flawless and well-reasoned solution. All steps are logically sound and the calculations are correct. The final polynomial is correct. Note that the provided rubric contains an error in Vieta's formulas (stating \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 = -b instead of b), which leads to an incorrect final answer in the rubric's key. The student correctly used the standard formulas and derived the correct result, thus earning full points.",
