    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution using the probability generating function method. This method is mathematically equivalent to the one outlined in the rubric. All key steps are present: deriving the formula for the probability of an even outcome, calculating the telescoping product, and substituting to find the final answer. The student also provides a second, valid solution using induction, which further demonstrates their understanding. The solution is flawless.",
