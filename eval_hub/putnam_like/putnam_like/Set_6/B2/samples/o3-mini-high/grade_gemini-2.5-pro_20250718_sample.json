    "comment": "The student correctly calculated the value of the telescoping product, earning full credit for that step (2 points). However, the solution fails to derive the general formula for the probability of an even number of heads, instead quoting it without justification. This omits the reasoning that accounts for 7 points in the rubric. Furthermore, the final answer was left in an unsimplified form, forfeiting the point for the final step.",
