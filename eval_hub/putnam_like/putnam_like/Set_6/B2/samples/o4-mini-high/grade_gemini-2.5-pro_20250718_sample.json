    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and well-reasoned solution. The use of an expectation identity involving indicator variables is a standard and elegant method to arrive at the general formula for the probability. This approach is a valid alternative to the algebraic expansion suggested in the rubric. All subsequent calculations, including the evaluation of the telescoping product and the final simplification, are performed flawlessly. Full credit is awarded.",
