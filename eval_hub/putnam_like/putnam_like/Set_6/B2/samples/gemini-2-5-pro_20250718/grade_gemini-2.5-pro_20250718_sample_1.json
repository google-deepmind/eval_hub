    "comment": "The solution is exemplary. While the student used the method of generating functions, which is different from the one described in the rubric, all the key logical and computational steps align perfectly with the rubric's requirements. The relationship between the probability of an even number of heads and the product \u220f(q_m - p_m) was correctly derived and used. The telescoping product was correctly calculated, and the final answer is correct. The student also provided a second, entirely correct proof using recurrence relations, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the material.",
