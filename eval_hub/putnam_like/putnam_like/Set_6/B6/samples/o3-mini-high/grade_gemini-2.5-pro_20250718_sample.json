    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although it does not follow the elementary recurrence relation method detailed in the main rubric, it perfectly matches the alternative correct approach described at the end of the rubric, which uses a local central limit theorem for lattice random walks. The argument is well-structured, correctly identifies the asymptotic behavior of the relevant probabilities, and correctly concludes the proof based on the properties of the periodic component of the limit theorem.",
