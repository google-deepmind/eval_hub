    "comment": "The student's solution uses an approach based on the Central Limit Theorem, which is entirely different from the method of recurrence relations outlined in the grading rubric. The attempted asymptotic argument is not rigorous; it incorrectly states the decay rate and asserts the crucial comparison of constants without justification. As none of the steps from the rubric are present or correctly addressed, no points can be awarded.",
