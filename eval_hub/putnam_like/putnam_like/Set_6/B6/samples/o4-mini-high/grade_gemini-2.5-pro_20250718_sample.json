    "comment": "The solution provides a complete and correct proof using the local central limit theorem, which is a valid and powerful alternative to the recurrence-based approach in the rubric. All steps, from setting up the random vectors and their covariance matrix to applying the theorem and deriving the asymptotics for p_n and q_n, are executed flawlessly. The conclusion follows logically from the correctly calculated asymptotic ratio of q_n/p_n. The work is elegant and demonstrates a strong command of the subject matter.",
