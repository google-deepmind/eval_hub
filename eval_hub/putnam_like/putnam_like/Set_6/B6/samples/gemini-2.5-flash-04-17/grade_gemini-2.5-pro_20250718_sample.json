    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The approach is different from the one suggested in the rubric, using the Local Limit Theorem for lattice random walks instead of recurrence relations. All steps, from re-formulating the problem as a random walk to correctly applying the theorem and drawing the final conclusion, are executed flawlessly. This constitutes a valid and arguably more powerful solution method, which is worthy of full credit.",
