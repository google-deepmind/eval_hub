    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a valid and powerful alternative approach. The student successfully reformulates the problem using centered variables, derives the key exact relation $q_n = 6p_{n+1}$ (which corresponds to the main part of the rubric's first step), and then uses a well-justified asymptotic analysis of $p_n$ (via the local central limit theorem) to prove that the inequality holds for all odd $n \\geq 3$, thus for infinitely many $n$. The reasoning is clear, logical, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject.",
