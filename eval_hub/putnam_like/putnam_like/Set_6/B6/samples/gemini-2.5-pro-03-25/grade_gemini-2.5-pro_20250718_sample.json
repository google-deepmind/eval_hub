    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method used (the Local Central Limit Theorem) differs from the recurrence relation approach outlined in the rubric, the argument is mathematically sound, elegant, and successfully proves the required result. The key steps, including the transformation to a 2D random walk, application of the LCLT, and the asymptotic analysis, are all executed flawlessly. Since the problem statement does not mandate a specific solution method, this valid alternative proof is awarded full marks.",
