    "comment": "The student used an alternative method based on the Central Limit Theorem instead of the recurrence relation approach outlined in the grading rubric. As the solution does not contain any of the steps specified in the rubric, no points can be awarded based on the provided grading scheme. Additionally, the submitted argument, while showing good intuition, is not fully rigorous due to the use of approximations without error analysis and contains a technical error in the application of the local CLT.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological deviation; Lack of rigor; Technical error in application of a theorem."
