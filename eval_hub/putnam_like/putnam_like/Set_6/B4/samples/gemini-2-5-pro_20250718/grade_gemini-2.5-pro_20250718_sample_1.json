    "comment": "The solution is flawless and provides a complete, rigorous argument. The student correctly identifies the key idea of using the conjugate term $(\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$. They correctly prove that the sum $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ is an integer using a binomial expansion, which is a valid alternative to the recurrence relation method suggested in the rubric. They also correctly show that $(\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ is between 0 and 1, and combine these facts to logically deduce the final answer. The reasoning is clear and well-structured.",
