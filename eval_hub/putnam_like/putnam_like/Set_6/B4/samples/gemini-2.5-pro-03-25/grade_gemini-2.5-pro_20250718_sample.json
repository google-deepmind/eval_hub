    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly identifies that the answer is of the form $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ and rigorously proves that this quantity is an integer and is indeed the smallest integer greater than the given expression. The method used to prove the sum is an integer (by defining a sequence $a_k = \\alpha^k+\\beta^k$) is slightly different from the one suggested in the standard solution but is perfectly valid and elegant. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and all claims are justified.",
