    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the form of the answer by considering the conjugate term $(\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$. The argument showing that $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ must be the smallest integer greater than $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n}$ (provided the sum is an integer) is flawless. However, the solution completely omits the proof that this sum is, in fact, an integer for all positive integers n. This justification is a critical and heavily weighted part of the problem, and its omission is a major flaw. The final answer form is correct, but it relies on an unproven assertion.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Omission of proof. The solution asserts that a key expression is an integer without providing any justification (e.g., via binomial expansion or a recurrence relation)."
