    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies that the answer is given by the expression $(\\sqrt{5} + 2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5} - 2)^{2n}$ and provides a clear argument for why this is the smallest integer greater than $(\\sqrt{5} + 2)^{2n}$, provided the expression is an integer. However, the solution fails to prove that this expression is indeed an integer for all n. It asserts this fact and states the correct recurrence relation without derivation, for which the rubric allocates a majority of the points.",
