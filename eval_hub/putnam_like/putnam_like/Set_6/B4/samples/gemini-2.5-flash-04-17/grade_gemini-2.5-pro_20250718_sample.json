    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem. The student correctly identifies that the sum $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ is the key. They prove this sum is an integer using the binomial theorem, which is a valid and well-executed alternative to the recurrence method suggested in the rubric. The argument is made fully rigorous by proving that $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n}$ is itself not an integer. The reasoning is clear, logical, and complete.",
