    "comment": "The solution is elegant and correct. The student correctly identifies that the answer is $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ by noting that the second term is a small positive number and the sum is an integer. The proof that the sum is an integer is done by establishing a valid linear recurrence relation with integer coefficients and initial values. All steps are clearly explained and logically sound.",
