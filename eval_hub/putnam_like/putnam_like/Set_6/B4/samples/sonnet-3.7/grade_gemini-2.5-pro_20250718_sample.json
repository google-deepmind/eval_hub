The student uses a valid and elegant alternative method (based on Pell's equation) instead of the recurrence relation approach outlined in the rubric. The reasoning is clear, logically sound, and correctly justifies that $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n} + (\\sqrt{5}-2)^{2n}$ is the smallest integer greater than $(\\sqrt{5}+2)^{2n}.",
