    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. Although the method differs entirely from the one outlined in the rubric, it is a standard and rigorous approach to this type of geometric probability problem. The student correctly translates the geometric condition into algebraic inequalities, properly models the sample space as a simplex, and flawlessly applies the principle of inclusion-exclusion to arrive at the correct probability. The reasoning is clear, and the execution is perfect.",
