    "comment": "The student provides a flawless and elegant solution using the method of spacings, which is a standard and powerful technique for this class of problems. The problem is correctly reformulated in terms of the Dirichlet distribution of arc lengths. The condition for an obtuse angle is correctly identified, and the probability of the complementary event (at least one angle not being obtuse) is correctly calculated using a standard formula for maximal 2-spacings. The argument and final answer are both correct. This is an exemplary solution that demonstrates a strong command of geometric probability.",
