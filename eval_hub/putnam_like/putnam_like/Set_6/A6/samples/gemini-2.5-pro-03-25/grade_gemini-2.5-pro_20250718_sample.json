    "comment": "The student correctly formulates the problem in terms of the sum of adjacent arc lengths and correctly identifies the condition for all angles to be obtuse. However, the chosen solution method\u2014a direct calculation using a formula from the literature\u2014is completely different from the approach detailed in the rubric, which is based on analyzing the complementary event (at least one acute angle). As the solution does not contain any of the specific steps outlined in the grading scheme, no points can be awarded based on the provided rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Methodological divergence: The solution does not follow the method required by the rubric. It pursues a valid but alternative path that does not align with any of the graded steps."
