    "comment": "The student's argument is based on an incorrect condition. The condition provided for an angle to be obtuse (the sum of adjacent central angles being greater than pi) is actually the condition for the angle to be acute. This fundamental geometric error invalidates the subsequent proof by contradiction and leads to an incorrect final answer of 0. The solution does not align with any of the required steps in the grading rubric.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major conceptual error in the geometric condition for an obtuse angle, which invalidates the entire solution."
