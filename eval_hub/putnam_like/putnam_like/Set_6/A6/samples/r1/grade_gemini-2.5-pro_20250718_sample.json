    "comment": "The solution does not follow the method outlined in the rubric. It fails to consider the complement event (at least one acute angle) and does not perform the required probability calculations. Furthermore, the fundamental geometric condition for an angle to be obtuse is incorrectly stated as the sum of adjacent arcs being less than half the circumference; this is the condition for an acute angle. The entire argument is based on this flawed premise. The final answer of 1 is an approximation, not the exact probability, and is reached through a non-rigorous, qualitative argument, rather than a precise calculation as required.",
