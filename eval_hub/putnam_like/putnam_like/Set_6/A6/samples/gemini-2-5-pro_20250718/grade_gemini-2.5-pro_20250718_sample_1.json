    "comment": "The student provides a complete and elegant solution that is mathematically sound and arrives at the correct answer. The method used is different from the one outlined in the rubric, but it is a standard and valid approach for this type of problem. The student correctly formulates the problem in terms of arc length inequalities and solves it using the 'broken stick' model, correctly identifying the necessary conditions of point splitting and interlacing. The reasoning is clear and well-structured. In contrast, the provided rubric appears to contain an error in its final calculation. The student's solution is flawless.",
