    "comment": "The student correctly sets up the problem by expressing the vertex angles in terms of the random arc lengths between points, leading to the correct condition that the sum of adjacent arcs must be less than half the circumference for all angles to be obtuse. The analysis for small n (n=3, 4) showing the probability is zero is also correct. However, the solution fails from this point. Instead of deriving the probability, the student quotes a formula without justification. Crucially, the student notes that this formula gives a non-zero probability for n=3, which contradicts their own correct finding. Proceeding with this flawed formula is a major error, and the final answer is incorrect. Partial credit is awarded for the valid initial setup and analysis.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical error: Used a formula despite having evidence from their own work that it was incorrect for a simple case. Incomplete derivation: Quoted a result without proof. Incorrect answer."
