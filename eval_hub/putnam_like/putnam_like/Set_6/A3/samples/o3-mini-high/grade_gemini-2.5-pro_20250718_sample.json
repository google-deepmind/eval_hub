    "comment": "The solution correctly defines an auxiliary function and applies the Mean Value Theorem to establish the key relation $f^{(n+1)}(c_n) = f(c_n)$ for a sequence $c_n \\to c$. This part of the proof is flawless and earns full credit for the first two steps of the rubric. However, the final step of the proof is incomplete. The argument jumps from $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f^{(n+1)}(c_n) = f(c)$ to the final answer $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f^{(n)}(c) = f(c)$ without justification. The crucial step of using the uniform boundedness of derivatives to show that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |f^{(n)}(c_{n-1}) - f^{(n)}(c)| = 0$ is missing.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Gap in reasoning / Missing justification. The solution fails to demonstrate why the limit can be evaluated at point c instead of the sequence c_n, a step that requires applying the Mean Value Theorem and using the uniform boundedness of derivatives."
