    "comment": "The solution is exceptionally well-written and logically sound. It correctly defines a helper function and applies Rolle's theorem to establish the key relationship f^(n+1)(\u03be_n) = f(\u03be_n). The subsequent limit argument, which uses the triangle inequality, is rigorous, clear, and perfectly justifies the final result by leveraging the uniform boundedness of the derivatives. The solution completely and correctly addresses all aspects outlined in the grading rubric.",
