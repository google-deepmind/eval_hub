    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly defines a helper function, applies Rolle's Theorem to find a key relationship between the function and its derivatives (f^(n+1)(c_n) = f(c_n)), and then uses the Mean Value Theorem along with the uniform boundedness of derivatives to show that lim f^(n)(c) equals lim f(c_{n-1}), which converges to f(c). The argument is logical, well-structured, and complete.",
