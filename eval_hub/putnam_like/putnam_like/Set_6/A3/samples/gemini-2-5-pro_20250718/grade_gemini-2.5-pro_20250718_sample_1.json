    "comment": "The solution is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and mathematically rigorous. Each step is justified and follows a logical progression. The student correctly identified the key idea of using an auxiliary function and Rolle's theorem, correctly calculated the necessary derivative, and correctly applied the Mean Value Theorem along with the uniform boundedness condition to complete the argument. The solution is flawless.",
