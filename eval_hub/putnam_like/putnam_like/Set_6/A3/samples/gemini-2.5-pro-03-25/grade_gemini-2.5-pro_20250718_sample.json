    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. They correctly define an auxiliary function, apply Rolle's Theorem, and compute the derivative to establish the key relation f^(n+1)(x_n) = f(x_n). The final limiting argument is structured slightly differently from the provided rubric but is entirely valid and well-executed, correctly using the continuity of f, the Mean Value Theorem, and the uniform boundedness of the derivatives to reach the conclusion. The reasoning is clear, detailed, and mathematically sound.",
