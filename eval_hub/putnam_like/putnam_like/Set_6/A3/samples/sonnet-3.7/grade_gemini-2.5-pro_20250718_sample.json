    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly defines an auxiliary function ($G_n(t)$), applies the Mean Value Theorem to find a key relationship ($f^{(n+1)}(\\xi_n) = f(\\xi_n)$), and then uses the uniform boundedness of the derivatives to rigorously take the limit and arrive at the desired conclusion. All steps are clearly explained and logically sound.",
