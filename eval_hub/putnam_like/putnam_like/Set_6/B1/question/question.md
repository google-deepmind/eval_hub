 Number the cells in a $2n \times 2n$ grid from $1$ to $4n^2$, starting at the top left and moving down to bottom along each column, then continuing at the top of the next column right and so on. Color half the cells black and half white, so that just half the cells in each row  and half the cells in each column are black. What is the minimum and the maximum possible sum of all numbers in the black cells.
