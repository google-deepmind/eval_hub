    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The student correctly formulates the number in each cell, sets up the total sum, and uses the given constraints on row and column sums to show that the total sum is independent of the specific valid coloring. The derivation is clear, logical, and all calculations are correct. The conclusion that the minimum and maximum sums are therefore identical and equal to this constant value is sound. The additional verification step demonstrates a thorough understanding of the problem.",
