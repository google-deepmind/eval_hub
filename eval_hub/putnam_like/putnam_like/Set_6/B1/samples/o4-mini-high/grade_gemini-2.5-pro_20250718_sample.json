    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly formulates the total sum using indicator variables for the black cells. The key insight to split the sum based on row and column indices is correctly applied. The constraints on the number of black cells per row and column are used effectively to simplify the expressions. The calculations are accurate, and the final conclusion that the sum is constant for any valid coloring\u2014thus making the minimum and maximum equal\u2014is perfectly justified.",
