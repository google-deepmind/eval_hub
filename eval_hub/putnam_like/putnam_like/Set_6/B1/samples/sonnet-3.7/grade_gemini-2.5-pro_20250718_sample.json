    "comment": "The student provides a clear, rigorous, and complete solution. By formalizing the problem with indicator variables, they correctly separate the sum into components based on row and column indices. The calculation for each component is correct, leveraging the problem's constraints perfectly. The final sum is derived correctly, and the student correctly concludes that since the sum is independent of the coloring, the minimum and maximum values must be the same. The solution is flawless.",
