    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It is well-structured, clear, and mathematically rigorous. The student correctly derives a formula for the cell numbering, formally states the constraints, and uses a direct calculation method to show that the sum is constant for any valid coloring. The final result is correct, and the conclusion that the minimum and maximum are equal is well-justified. The inclusion of an example for n=1 is a nice touch.",
