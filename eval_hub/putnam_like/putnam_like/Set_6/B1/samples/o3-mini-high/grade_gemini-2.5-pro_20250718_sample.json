    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly formulates the sum of the numbers in the black cells and shows, through direct and rigorous algebraic manipulation, that this sum is constant for any valid coloring. The logic is clear, all calculations are accurate, and the conclusion that the minimum and maximum sums are identical is well-justified. The student's approach is more formal than the one outlined in the rubric but contains all the key components for a full score.",
