    "comment": "The student correctly represents the set of all-ones integers and successfully finds two families of solutions: the constant polynomials and a set of linear polynomials. However, the solution is critically flawed because it incorrectly concludes that no solutions of degree greater than one exist. This error stems from an unsubstantiated (and false) claim that the degree must be 1, which causes the student to miss the majority of the solutions. The core argument for classifying all possible polynomials is therefore missing.",
