    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the form of elements in the set O and successfully finds all constant and linear polynomial solutions. However, the solution's main weakness is the incorrect dismissal of all higher-degree polynomials. The provided asymptotic argument is flawed and does not follow the general method outlined in the rubric, leading to a failure to find the complete set of solutions.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect Argument/Proof: The justification for ruling out polynomials of degree 2 or higher is incorrect. Incomplete Solution: Due to the flawed argument, the solution misses all valid non-linear polynomials."
