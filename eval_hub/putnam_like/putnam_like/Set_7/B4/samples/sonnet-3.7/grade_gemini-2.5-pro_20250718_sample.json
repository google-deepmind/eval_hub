    "comment": "The student correctly identified the algebraic form of the numbers in the set $\\mathbb{O}$. However, the solution is fundamentally flawed due to a misinterpretation of the problem statement; the student incorrectly assumed the polynomial's coefficients must be independent of the fixed value $p$. This led to the erroneous exclusion of most valid solutions. The solution does not follow the key steps outlined in the rubric, such as the change of variables to a simpler polynomial problem, and as a result, fails to find the general form of the solution, only identifying a few specific cases.",
