    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. They correctly transform the problem into one concerning a polynomial that maps powers of p to powers of p. The argument to demonstrate that this new polynomial must be a monomial is sound and well-executed. The final form of the polynomials and the conditions on the integer parameters are correctly derived and clearly stated, covering all cases.",
