    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem. The student correctly characterizes the set $\\mathbb{O}$, applies a clever polynomial transformation, and rigorously deduces the form of the transformed polynomial using a limit argument. The logic for showing that the polynomial must be a monomial is flawless. The final family of polynomials is correctly derived, including the constraints on the parameters. The solution is well-structured and easy to follow.",
