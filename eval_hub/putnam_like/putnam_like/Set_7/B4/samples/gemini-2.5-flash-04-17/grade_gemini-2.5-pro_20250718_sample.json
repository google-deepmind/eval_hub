    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the structure of the problem by transforming it into a condition on a polynomial mapping powers of $p$ to powers of $p$. The core argument to show that this new polynomial must be a monomial is well-reasoned and very detailed. The final step of translating back to the original polynomial $f(x)$ is done correctly, but a logical error in deriving the conditions on the integer parameters leads to an incomplete set of solutions.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical error/incomplete analysis: The derivation of the conditions on the parameters $d$ and $L$ is flawed. The deduction from '$d+L \\geq 1$ and $d \\geq 1$' to '$L \\geq 0$' is incorrect, which unnecessarily restricts the set of solutions and excludes valid polynomials (e.g., for $d=2, L=-1$). A minor confusion regarding the constant term of the transformed polynomial was also noted but did not affect the main argument."
