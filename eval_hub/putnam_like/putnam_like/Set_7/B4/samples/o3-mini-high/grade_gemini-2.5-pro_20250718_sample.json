    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the structure of the set $\\mathbb{O}$ and appropriately defines an auxiliary polynomial $T(x)$ to simplify the problem (Step 1). However, the central argument to prove that $T(x)$ must be a monomial of the form $p^c x^d$ is missing; the solution merely asserts this crucial fact without justification (Step 2). While the final form of the polynomial $f(x)$ is correctly derived from the (unproven) form of $T(x)$, the characterization of the parameters $(c,d)$ is slightly incorrect, missing some valid solutions.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical gap / Unproven assertion: The solution fails to prove why the auxiliary polynomial must be a monomial. Minor error in final answer: The conditions on the parameters are too restrictive, excluding some valid polynomials."
