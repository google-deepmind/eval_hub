    "comment": "The student starts with a clever reformulation of the exponent and a sound strategy of splitting the sum based on parity. However, the solution's central argument relies on crucial properties ($E_m \\ge 0, O_m \\le 0$) which are stated as known facts without any proof. Furthermore, the final step to establish the strict inequality ($\\ge 1$) is based on a conjectured periodicity that is not rigorously proven and appears to be inconsistent with computed values. The solution contains good initial ideas but lacks the required rigor for a complete proof.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The proof has two main issues: a major logical gap, where a key result is asserted without proof, and flawed reasoning, where the argument relies on an unproven and likely false conjecture about the periodicity of a sequence."
