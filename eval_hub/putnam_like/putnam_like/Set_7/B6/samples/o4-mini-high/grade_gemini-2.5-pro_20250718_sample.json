    "comment": "The student presents an alternative approach using concepts from discrepancy theory, which differs entirely from the method outlined in the rubric. The initial reformulation of the sum into a counting problem involving the distribution of points is correct and merits a point, being analogous in spirit to the first step of the rubric. However, the remainder of the proof is incorrect. The central claim, a discrepancy estimate of the form |#{...} - (n+1)/2| \u2264 1, is false for general n. Additionally, a calculation error is made in the final inequality, which erroneously leads to the desired result of \u2265 1; the correct calculation based on the student's (false) premise would yield \u2265 -2. As the proof's main argument is invalid and does not follow the rubric's steps, no further points can be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical error (the proof is based on a false claim about discrepancy bounds) and a calculation error."
