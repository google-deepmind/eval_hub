    "comment": "The student correctly verifies the base case for n=0 and computes several initial terms of the sum, which is a good start. However, the core of the solution is not a rigorous proof. The argument relies on observing a pattern for the first few terms and then asserting that this pattern continues for all n without providing any mathematical justification. The solution does not follow the required analytical steps, such as deriving a formula for the lengths of the runs of identical terms or using a formal inductive argument.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Argument from example / Lack of rigor; Incomplete analysis."
