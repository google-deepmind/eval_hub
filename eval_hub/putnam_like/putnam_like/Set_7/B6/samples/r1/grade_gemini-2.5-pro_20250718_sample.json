    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies and verifies the base case for n=0, earning one point. However, the subsequent inductive proof is invalid. The argument presented is a logical fallacy (circular reasoning), as it assumes the conclusion (that the sum cannot be 0) to prove itself. The solution fails to engage with the complex structure of the sequence, missing the key insights about cluster lengths and their connection to Beatty sequences, which are essential for a correct proof as outlined in the rubric.",
