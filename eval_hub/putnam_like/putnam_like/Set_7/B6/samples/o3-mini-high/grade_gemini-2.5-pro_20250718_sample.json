    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the block structure of the sequence, where terms are grouped by the value of m in `floor(k(sqrt(3)-1))=m`. The derivation that the size of these blocks is always 1 or 2 is a key insight and is well-executed, earning full points for the initial analysis steps. However, the core of the proof, an inductive argument, is critically flawed. It relies on incorrect assertions, such as the sum being non-decreasing within a block and that even-indexed blocks always contribute at least +2. The logic presented does not constitute a valid proof.",
