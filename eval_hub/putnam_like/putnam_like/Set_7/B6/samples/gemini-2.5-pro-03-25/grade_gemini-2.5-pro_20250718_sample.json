    "comment": "The student presents a very clear and well-structured solution. The approach of analyzing the problem by grouping terms where the exponent is constant is excellent. The main argument is an induction on the block index, which is mostly carried out correctly. The proof correctly reduces the problem to showing that certain partial sums ($s_m$) are greater than or equal to 1. However, the inductive step only establishes that these sums are non-negative. The student correctly identifies the precise condition under which the proof would fail (i.e., the sum would be 0), and provides numerical evidence that this condition does not occur, but does not provide a formal proof for this crucial step. This constitutes a significant gap in the argument.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof. The solution relies on a key lemma that is stated and verified for a few cases but not proven in general."
