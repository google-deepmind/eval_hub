    "comment": "The student provides a very clear and well-structured solution. The approach of analyzing the sum by grouping terms into 'blocks' based on the constant value of the exponent is excellent and equivalent to the rubric's method. The setup of the proof by induction on the sum at the end of these blocks ($T_m$) is sound, and the inductive step for even-indexed blocks is proven correctly. However, the proof for odd-indexed blocks relies on a critical assertion: that if a block size is 2, the preceding block sum is large enough to ensure the total sum remains $\\geq 1$. The student correctly identifies this as the crux of their argument but does not provide a formal proof for this assertion, instead relying on checking a few examples. This constitutes a significant logical gap in an otherwise strong solution.",
