    "comment": "The solution is correct and well-structured. The student successfully proves the inequality by first using the Multinomial Theorem to establish a base inequality and then applying the Rearrangement Inequality to handle the permutation term. The argument is logical and every step is justified. Although the approach differs slightly from the most direct path outlined in the rubric, it is entirely valid and demonstrates a strong command of relevant mathematical principles.",
