    "comment": "The solution does not follow the provided rubric, which outlines a proof using the multinomial theorem. Instead, it attempts an alternative approach using the rearrangement inequality and induction. This approach is conceptually valid but is executed poorly. The proof is incomplete, relying on assertions like 'This holds by comparing terms' and a vaguely described inductive step, which are not rigorous. A single point is awarded for the correct insight of applying the rearrangement inequality to identify the maximal case for the right-hand side, but no further credit can be given as none of the key steps from the rubric are present and the alternative proof is fundamentally flawed.",
