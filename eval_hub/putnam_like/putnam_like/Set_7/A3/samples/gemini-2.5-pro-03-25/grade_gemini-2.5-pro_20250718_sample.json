    "comment": "The solution is complete and logically flawless. The student presents a valid alternative proof strategy that differs from the one in the rubric. They correctly use the multinomial theorem to establish a strict inequality for the identity permutation and then correctly apply the Rearrangement Inequality to generalize the result to any permutation. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and arrives at the correct conclusion.",
