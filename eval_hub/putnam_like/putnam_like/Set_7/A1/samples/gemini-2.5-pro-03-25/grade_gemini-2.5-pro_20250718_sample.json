    "comment": "The solution is excellent. It correctly uses the concept of the minimal polynomial, its properties (dividing any annihilating polynomial, degree constraint from matrix size), and its relation to the eigenvalues. The student systematically identifies all possible minimal polynomials for A given the constraints and demonstrates in each case that the desired property, A^3 = A^2, holds. The argument is clear, logically sound, and complete.",
