    "comment": "The solution is correct and logically sound. It correctly identifies the constraints on the minimal polynomial and proceeds by a case analysis, reaching the correct conclusion. The only minor flaw is that the argument is slightly inefficient. The fact that the minimal polynomial, `m_A(x)`, must divide `x^k(x-1)` immediately implies that `(x-1)^2` cannot be a factor of `m_A(x)`. The student includes this as a case to be checked and then correctly shows it leads to a contradiction, but it could have been ruled out from the start.",
