    "comment": "The student's solution is flawless and exceptionally well-explained. It correctly establishes the properties of the minimal polynomial (dividing x^k(x-1) and having a degree of at most 2). The case analysis to determine all possible minimal polynomials is systematic, complete, and correct, crucially noting why (x-1)^2 is not a possible factor. Finally, each of the four resulting cases is correctly shown to imply A^3 = A^2. The work perfectly aligns with the grading rubric and demonstrates a full understanding of the concepts.",
