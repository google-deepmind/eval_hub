    "comment": "The solution correctly identifies the annihilating polynomial and the fact that the minimal polynomial must divide it, earning the first 2 points. However, the subsequent case analysis is flawed. The list of possible minimal polynomials is incomplete, as it omits the case m_A(x) = x^2 (which is possible since k>=3). This omission leads to the false conclusion that A must be diagonalizable. The proof is therefore incomplete as it does not cover the non-diagonalizable case (where A is nilpotent). The argument correctly handles the diagonalizable cases, for which partial credit is awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete Case Analysis; Logical Error (made a false claim that A must be diagonalizable)."
