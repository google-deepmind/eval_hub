    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The argument correctly uses the concept of the minimal polynomial, correctly deduces that its degree is at most 2, and that it must divide x^k(x-1). The solution then systematically considers all possible forms of the minimal polynomial and demonstrates that A^3=A^2 holds in every case. The reasoning is clear, well-structured, and flawless.",
