    "comment": "The solution is excellent and demonstrates a full understanding of the problem. The student correctly identifies that the minimal polynomial must divide x^k(x-1) and that its degree is at most 2. The case analysis based on the possible minimal polynomials is exhaustive and every case is handled correctly. The argument to rule out the m_A(x) = (x-1)^2 case is sound and rigorous, even though it follows a different (but equally valid) path than the one outlined in the rubric. The final conclusion is well-supported.",
