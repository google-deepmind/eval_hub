    "comment": "The solution follows a valid alternative method by analyzing the Jordan form of A. The determination of A's eigenvalues and the subsequent argument for the diagonalizable case are correct. However, the reasoning for the non-diagonalizable case is flawed. The student incorrectly assumes the matrix `cos(A)` in its Jordan basis must be equal to the target matrix, failing to account for the change of basis. This is a fundamental error that invalidates the second half of the proof.",
