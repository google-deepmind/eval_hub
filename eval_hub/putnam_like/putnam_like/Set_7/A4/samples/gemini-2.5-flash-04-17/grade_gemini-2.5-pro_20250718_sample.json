    "comment": "The solution is complete and correct. Although it follows a different path from the one suggested in the rubric, the argument is mathematically rigorous and sound. The student correctly deduces the necessary form of matrix A by considering commutativity and eigenvalues. The subsequent explicit calculation of cos(A) for this form of matrix is performed flawlessly and leads to the correct contradiction. This is an excellent alternative solution deserving of full marks.",
