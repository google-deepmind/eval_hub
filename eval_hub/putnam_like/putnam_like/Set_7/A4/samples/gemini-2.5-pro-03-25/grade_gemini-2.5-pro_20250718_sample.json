    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct solution. The first step, calculating what $\\sin^2 A$ must be, is executed perfectly. For the second part, the student employs a sophisticated and valid argument using eigenvalues and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to prove that no such matrix $\\sin A$ can exist. Although this method differs from the direct algebraic approach suggested in the rubric, it is equally rigorous and leads to the correct conclusion. The entire solution is logically sound and well-presented.",
