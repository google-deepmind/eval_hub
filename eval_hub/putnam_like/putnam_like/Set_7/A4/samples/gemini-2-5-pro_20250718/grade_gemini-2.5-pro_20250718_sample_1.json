    "comment": "The solution is flawless and provides a complete, rigorous proof. Although the method used is different from the one in the rubric, it is a well-known and equally valid approach. The student correctly determines the form of matrix A using commutativity and eigenvalue properties, then correctly computes cos(A) for a matrix of this form, and finally shows that this leads to a contradiction. The reasoning is clear and every step is justified.",
