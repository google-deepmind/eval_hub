    "comment": "The student provides a complete and correct proof, demonstrating a strong understanding of matrix functions and their properties (spectral mapping theorem, functions of Jordan blocks). Although the method used (based on eigenvalues and diagonalizability) is different from the one outlined in the rubric (based on the `sin^2 A + cos^2 A = I` identity), it is a perfectly valid and rigorous alternative approach. Therefore, full credit is awarded for a flawless solution.",
