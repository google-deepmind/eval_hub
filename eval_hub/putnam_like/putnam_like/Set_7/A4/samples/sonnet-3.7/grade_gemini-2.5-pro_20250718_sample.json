    "comment": "The student reaches the correct conclusion, and the core of their algebraic argument\u2014showing that no matrix M exists such that M^2 is a non-zero nilpotent matrix of the given form\u2014is correct and executed flawlessly. This algebraic manipulation is the main challenge in the rubric's second step. However, the student's overall argument is invalid due to a major logical flaw. They unjustifiably assume that the problem reduces to solving -A^2/2! = C - I by ignoring all higher-order terms of the cosine series. This assumption is not proven and makes the argument incomplete, as it only addresses a special case. The solution does not follow the rubric's method of using the identity sin^2(A) + cos^2(A) = I, which would have correctly justified why one needs to analyze the square of a matrix.",
