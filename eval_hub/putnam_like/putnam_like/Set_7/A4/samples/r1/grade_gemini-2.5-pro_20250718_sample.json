    "comment": "The student reaches the correct conclusion that no such matrix exists. However, the solution uses an entirely different method based on eigenvalue analysis, which is not the method specified in the grading rubric. The rubric requires a specific algebraic approach using the identity sin\u00b2(A) + cos\u00b2(A) = I. Since none of the steps outlined in the rubric were performed, no points can be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary issue is a failure to follow the solution path required by the rubric. The alternative method presented, while conceptually sound, also contains some minor imprecisions in the stated formulas for functions of matrices."
