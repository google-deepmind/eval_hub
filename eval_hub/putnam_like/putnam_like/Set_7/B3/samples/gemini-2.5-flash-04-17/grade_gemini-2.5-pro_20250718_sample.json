    "comment": "The solution is excellent and entirely correct. The student first provides a rigorous argument to show that any function satisfying the condition must be non-positive. This insight leads them to a very simple and elegant counterexample, f(x) = -1. The student then correctly verifies that this function satisfies the hypothesis but fails the conclusion. Although the counterexample is different from the one in the rubric, the logical structure and correctness of the argument merit full points.",
