    "comment": "The student has reached the wrong conclusion (that the statement is true, when it is false). The proof provided contains a critical logical flaw. The reasoning that $f(x_0)$ must be zero is based on the inequality $f'(x_0) \\ge \\frac{n f(x_0)}{x_0}$. While this argument correctly shows that we cannot have $f(x_0) > 0$ (as the right side would diverge to $+\\infty$), it fails if $f(x_0) < 0$, in which case the right side diverges to $-\\infty$, which poses no contradiction for a finite $f'(x_0)$. Since the entire approach is fundamentally different from the counterexample-based solution in the rubric and leads to an incorrect answer, no points can be awarded.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect conclusion and a major logical error in the proof. The argument fails to consider all cases, leading to an incorrect deduction that $f(x)$ must be the zero function."
