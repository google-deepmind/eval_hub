    "comment": "The student has reached the incorrect conclusion. The statement is false, and the intended solution path involves finding a counterexample. The student's attempt to prove the statement is true contains multiple fundamental errors. The argument that f(x) must be non-negative is based on a flawed logical deduction. Furthermore, the main inductive step relies on differentiating an inequality, which is not a valid mathematical operation in general. As the student did not provide a counterexample and verify its properties, no points can be awarded according to the rubric.",
