    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies that the statement is false and provides a valid counterexample, $f(x)=-1$. The reasoning is exceptionally clear and rigorous. The student first deduces general properties that any such function must satisfy ($f(x) \\leq 0$ and $f'(x) \\geq 0$) and then uses this insight to find a simple counterexample. The verification that the counterexample satisfies the hypotheses and violates the conclusion is complete and correct. The work fully satisfies all criteria in the grading rubric.",
