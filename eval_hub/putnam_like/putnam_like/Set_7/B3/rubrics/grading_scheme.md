Solution step (1 point):
No, it is not true. Consider
$$
f(x) = \ln x.
$$

Solution step (7 points):
Then clearly $f(x)$ is increasing and for $n \geq 1$
$$
\left( \frac{\ln x}{x^n} \right)' = \frac{x^{n-1} - n x^{n-1} \ln x}{x^{2n}} = \frac{x^{n-1} (1 - n \ln x)}{x^{2n}} > 0, \quad x \in (0,1).
$$
Hence $\frac{f(x)}{x^n}$ is increasing for all $n \geq 0$. 

Solution step (2 points):
However
$$
\left( \ln x \right)'' = - \frac{1}{x^2} < 0, \quad x \in (0,1).
$$
