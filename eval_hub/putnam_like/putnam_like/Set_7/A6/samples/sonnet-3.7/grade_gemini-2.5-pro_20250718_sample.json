    "comment": "The student correctly verifies that the constant function f(x)=1 is a solution. However, the subsequent attempt to prove uniqueness is fundamentally flawed. The 'perturbation approach' is not a rigorous mathematical proof for this type of problem, as it unjustifiably assumes any solution must be infinitesimally close to the constant one. This invalid method causes the student to miss the entire family of non-constant solutions and incorrectly conclude that f(x)=1 is unique. The solution does not engage with any of the key steps required by the rubric, such as analyzing limits or deriving the simplified functional equation.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major Logical Flaw: The use of a perturbation method is not a rigorous proof and relies on unstated assumptions. Incomplete Solution: The analysis fails to find the non-constant solutions. Incorrect Conclusion: The final claim that f(x)=1 is the unique solution is false."
