    "comment": "The student begins with a valid and clever reduction of the functional equation. The identity derived by setting x=y=z (equation 3 in the student's work) is correct and a key step. However, the argument collapses immediately after this. There is a major logical error in step 2.3 in deriving equation (4) from equation (2), where a term is unjustifiably dropped. This is followed by a computational error in solving the resulting (and already incorrect) system of equations. Finally, the conclusion that f(t)=1 for all t>0 rests on an unproven and non-obvious claim about the range of a function. The final answer is also incomplete, as it misses the family of non-constant solutions.",
