    "comment": "The student correctly identified and verified the constant solution $f(x)=1$. However, the solution fails to make any progress on the main parts of the problem as outlined in the rubric. Key steps, such as determining the limit of $f(x)$ as $x \\to 0^+$, simplifying the equation, and analyzing the properties of non-constant solutions, are either missing or replaced by unsubstantiated claims. Crucially, the solution incorrectly concludes that this is the only solution, missing the entire family of non-constant solutions.",
