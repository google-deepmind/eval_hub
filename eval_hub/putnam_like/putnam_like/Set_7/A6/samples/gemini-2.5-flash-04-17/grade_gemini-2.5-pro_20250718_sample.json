    "comment": "The student correctly verified that f(x)=1 is a solution and, assuming the limit at zero is 1, correctly derived the key intermediate equation $f(y f(z)) + f(z f(y)) = 1 + f(y+z)$. However, the proof that the limit at zero must be 1 is missing a justification and is simply asserted. The main part of the argument, which attempts to show that f(x)=1 is the only solution, contains a fatal logical flaw (circular reasoning) as it assumes f(1)=1 to prove consequences that are then used to show f(1)=1. Finally, the solution is incomplete as the entire family of non-constant solutions, $f(x) = 1/(1+cx)$ for $c>0$, was missed.",
