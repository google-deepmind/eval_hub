    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the constant solution f(x)=1 by substituting a constant function into the equation. However, the rest of the solution is not a valid mathematical proof. The argument that no other solutions exist is based on intuition and assertion ('it is very difficult to reconcile', 'not compatible with continuity') rather than rigorous deduction. The solution misses all of the key analytical steps required by the rubric, such as taking limits, simplifying the equation, and performing the complex analysis to find or rule out non-constant solutions. The final conclusion that the constant function is the only solution is incorrect.",
