    "comment": "The student correctly identifies and verifies the constant solution $f(x)=1$ and a specific non-constant solution $f(x)=1/(1+x)$. The derivation of the intermediate equation $f(xf(y)) + f(yf(x)) = 1 + f(x+y)$ is also correct. However, the overall logical structure is flawed as it relies on the unproven assumption that the limit of $f(x)$ at infinity exists. Furthermore, the solution is incomplete as it fails to identify the general family of solutions $f(x) = 1/(1+cx)$ for $c \\ge 0$.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Logical gap (unproven assumption about limit at infinity); Incomplete solution set (missed the general family of solutions); Non-rigorous derivation (guess and check)."
