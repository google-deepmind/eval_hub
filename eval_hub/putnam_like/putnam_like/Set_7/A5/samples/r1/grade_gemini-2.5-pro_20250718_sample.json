    "comment": "The student correctly identifies that the statement is false and provides a well-constructed and valid counterexample. The reasoning, while brief, correctly captures the essential idea that the sequence of factorials grows too quickly to be frequently intersected by any given geometric progression. The solution is concise and demonstrates a complete understanding of the problem. It is worth noting that the provided rubric's proof is flawed, as it implicitly assumes that the sequence (m_k) does not grow too fast, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement.",
