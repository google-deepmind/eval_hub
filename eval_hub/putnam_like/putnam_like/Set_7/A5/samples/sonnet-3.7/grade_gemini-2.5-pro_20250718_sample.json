    "comment": "The student incorrectly concludes that the statement is false and attempts to construct a counterexample. The core argument for the counterexample is that for any given $\\gamma > 1$, the sequence $\\lfloor \\gamma^{m_k} \\rfloor$ will only take on values that are powers of two for a finite number of terms. This assertion is stated without a rigorous proof and is fundamentally incorrect. The rubric outlines the correct proof, which establishes that the statement is true. A key part of the correct proof is demonstrating that for any sparse sequence of integers (like powers of two), a specific $\\gamma > 1$ can be constructed such that $\\lfloor \\gamma^{m_k} \\rfloor$ matches that sequence infinitely often, which directly contradicts the student's claim and invalidates their counterexample. The student's solution earns no points as it arrives at the wrong conclusion via a flawed argument and does not follow any of the valid steps outlined in the rubric.",
