    "comment": "The student concludes that the statement is false, whereas the correct answer is true. The solution attempts to construct a counterexample, but the argument that this counterexample satisfies the condition is flawed. The student correctly shows that for a fixed $\\gamma > 1$ and a large factorial $N!$, the equation $\\lfloor \\gamma^{m_k} \\rfloor = N!$ can hold for at most one value of $k$. However, they incorrectly conclude from this that $\\lfloor \\gamma^{m_k} \\rfloor$ can be a factorial for only a finite number of $k$'s. This does not rule out the possibility of having an infinite sequence of pairs $(k_j, N_j)$ such that $\\lfloor \\gamma^{m_{k_j}} \\rfloor = N_j!$. The solution does not follow the correct line of reasoning outlined in the rubric and thus earns no points.",
