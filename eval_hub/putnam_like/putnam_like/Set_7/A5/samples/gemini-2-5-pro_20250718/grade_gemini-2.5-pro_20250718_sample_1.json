    "comment": "The student attempts to construct a counterexample, which is a valid approach. The algebraic manipulation to analyze the condition $\\lfloor \\gamma^{m_j} \\rfloor = n_k$ is correct and shows good understanding. However, the core of the argument\u2014proving that this equation has only a finite number of solutions for any given $\\gamma > 1$\u2014contains a critical logical error. The student's reasoning for finiteness is flawed, and the assertion is ultimately incorrect, as the rubric's proof demonstrates. This leads to the wrong overall conclusion.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect conclusion, logical fallacy, and reliance on an unproven (and false) central claim."
