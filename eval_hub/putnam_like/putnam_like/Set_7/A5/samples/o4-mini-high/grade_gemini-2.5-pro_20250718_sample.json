    "comment": "The student correctly concludes that the statement is false and attempts the correct strategy of constructing a counter-example. However, the core argument for the construction is flawed. The assertion that for any given \u03b3 > 1, the set {k : \u230a\u03b3^(2^k)\u230b \u2208 F} is finite is incorrect; for most \u03b3 > 1, this set is infinite. This invalidates the definition of K(\u03b3) and the entire counter-example. Partial credit is awarded for the correct conclusion and overall strategy, which is more insight than the provided rubric demonstrates.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incorrect Justification. The proof of the counter-example relies on a false number-theoretic claim about the sequence \u230a\u03b3^(2^k)\u230b. The construction is not well-defined as a result."
