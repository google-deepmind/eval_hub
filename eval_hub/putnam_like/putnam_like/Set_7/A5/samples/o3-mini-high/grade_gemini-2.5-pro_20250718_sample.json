    "comment": "The student correctly identifies the overall proof strategy (proof by contradiction) and sets it up properly. However, the core of the argument, which involves constructing a specific $\\gamma > 1$ that reveals the non-convergence, is fatally flawed. The student's method of taking a limit of a sequence of $\\gamma_j$ values fails due to two main errors: 1) there is no justification that this sequence of $\\gamma_j$ converges to a value $\\gamma_0 > 1$, and 2) the subsequent claim that $\\lfloor \\gamma_j^{m_{j_k}} \\rfloor$ is 'close' to $\\lfloor \\gamma_0^{m_{j_k}} \\rfloor$ is mathematically incorrect. The solution misses the rigorous construction required to solve the problem.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Major logical gaps and unjustified assumptions (e.g., asserting the convergence of a sequence to a specific type of limit without proof); incorrect mathematical claim regarding the behavior of the floor function."
