    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly establishes the integrability of g(x) by applying the triangle inequality for integrals and then using Fubini's theorem on the absolute value. The change of integration order is derived and explained perfectly. The second part of the proof, showing the equality of the integrals, correctly re-applies Fubini's theorem (justified by the first part) and follows the same logical steps. All calculations are correct and clearly presented.",
