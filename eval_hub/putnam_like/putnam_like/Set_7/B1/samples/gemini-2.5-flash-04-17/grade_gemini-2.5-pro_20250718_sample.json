    "comment": "The student provides a completely correct and elegant solution. Instead of a direct application of Fubini's theorem as suggested by the rubric, the student correctly identifies the function g as a convolution of f with an indicator function. They then correctly apply standard theorems about convolutions of L^1 functions to show that g is integrable and to compute its integral. This is a valid and sophisticated approach that demonstrates a strong understanding of the material. Full credit is awarded.",
