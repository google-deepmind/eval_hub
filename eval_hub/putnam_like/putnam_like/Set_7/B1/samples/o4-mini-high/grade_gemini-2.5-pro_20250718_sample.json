    "comment": "The solution is flawless and demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concepts. It correctly establishes the integrability of g using Tonelli's theorem, including the key steps of applying the triangle inequality and changing the order of integration. It then correctly applies Fubini's theorem to show the equality of the integrals. The argument is well-structured, clear, and even includes a proof of the measurability of g, which is a commendable and necessary detail.",
