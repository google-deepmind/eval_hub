    "comment": "The solution is exceptionally well-written, clear, and mathematically rigorous. It correctly applies the triangle inequality for integrals, followed by a flawless application of Tonelli's and Fubini's theorems. The justification for using these theorems is explicitly and correctly stated. The derivation of the new integration bounds after swapping the order of integration is perfect. Both parts of the problem are solved completely and correctly.",
