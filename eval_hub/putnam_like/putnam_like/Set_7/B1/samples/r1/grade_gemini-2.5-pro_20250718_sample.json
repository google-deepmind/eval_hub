    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly establishes the integrability of g using the triangle inequality and Tonelli's theorem, with a proper change of integration limits. It then correctly calculates the integral of g using Fubini's theorem, again with the correct change of limits. The justification for using both theorems is clearly stated.",
