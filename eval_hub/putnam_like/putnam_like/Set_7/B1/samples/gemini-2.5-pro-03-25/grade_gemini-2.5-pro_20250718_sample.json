    "comment": "The solution is excellent and fully correct. All steps are logically sound and clearly explained. The use of characteristic functions is appropriate and the application of Tonelli's and Fubini's theorems is correctly justified by showing the integrability of the function on the product space first. The additional proof of the continuity of g(x) to establish its measurability is a commendable and rigorous step.",
