This step is worth 7 points.
Take any $w \in G \setminus \{1\}$ (such an element exists, since $|G| \geq 2$). Then, clearly
$$
\sum_{z \in G} z = \sum_{z \in G} wz = w \sum_{z \in G} z.
$$

This step is worth 3 points.
Hence
$$
(1-w) \sum_{z \in G} z = 0.
$$
Since $1-w \neq 0$, we obtain $\sum_{z \in G} z = 0$.
