    "comment": "The student's solution is exemplary. The first method provided aligns perfectly with the logic outlined in the grading rubric. The student correctly identifies a non-identity element $g$, shows that multiplication by $g$ permutes the group elements, and correctly establishes the equation $S = gS$. The subsequent algebraic step, $(g-1)S=0$, and the conclusion that $S=0$ because $g \neq 1$ are also flawlessly executed. The level of detail and clarity is excellent. The inclusion of a second, also correct, method further demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic.",
