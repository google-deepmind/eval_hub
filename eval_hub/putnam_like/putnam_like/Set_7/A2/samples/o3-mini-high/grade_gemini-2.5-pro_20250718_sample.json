    "comment": "The solution is flawless and well-argued. The student correctly identifies a non-identity element z_0, shows that multiplication by this element permutes the group, and uses this fact to establish the key identity S = z_0 S. The conclusion that the sum is zero follows logically. The reasoning is clear, complete, and fully aligns with the grading rubric.",
