The student correctly identifies a non-identity element `a`, demonstrates the key insight that multiplication by `a` permutes the group elements, and uses this to establish the equation `aS = S`. The final algebraic steps to show `S=0` are also perfectly executed. The reasoning is clear and complete.",
