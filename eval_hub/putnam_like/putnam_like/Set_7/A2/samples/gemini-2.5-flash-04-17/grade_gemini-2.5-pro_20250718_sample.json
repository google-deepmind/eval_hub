    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies a non-identity element 'g' and proves that multiplication by 'g' permutes the group elements. The argument then correctly establishes the key equation S = gS and uses the fact that g is not 1 to conclude that the sum S must be zero. The reasoning is rigorous, well-explained, and complete.",
