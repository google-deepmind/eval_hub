    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly identifies a non-identity element `w` and demonstrates that multiplication by `w` is a permutation of the group `G`. This correctly establishes the key equation `S = wS`. The argument is concluded perfectly by showing that since `w` is not 1, the sum `S` must be zero. The reasoning is clear, rigorous, and complete.",
