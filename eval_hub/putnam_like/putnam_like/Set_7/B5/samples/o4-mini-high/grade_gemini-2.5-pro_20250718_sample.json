    "comment": "The student correctly finds all affine solutions to the functional equation using an ansatz. This leads to the correct families of solutions, $g(x)=x$ and $g(x)=-x/2+c$. However, the solution provides no proof that these are the *only* continuous solutions. The student merely asserts that a more refined argument would show this, which completely omits the main substance and difficulty of the problem (worth 9/10 points on the rubric). Credit is given for finding and verifying the solutions, but the lack of a proof of completeness is a major flaw.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Incomplete proof / Missing justification. The solution finds all candidate solutions but fails to prove that no other solutions exist. The argument for completeness is asserted rather than demonstrated."
