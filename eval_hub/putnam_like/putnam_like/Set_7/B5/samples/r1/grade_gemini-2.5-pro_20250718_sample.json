    "comment": "The student correctly finds all solutions by assuming from the outset that the function must be linear (affine). The algebraic derivation for this special case is performed correctly. However, the solution fails to prove that these are the *only* continuous solutions. The crucial and most difficult part of the problem\u2014proving that any continuous solution must be linear\u2014is replaced by a single, unsubstantiated claim in \"Step 3\". This is a major logical gap, as the majority of the points are awarded for the rigorous deduction showing why non-linear solutions are impossible.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "Unjustified Assumption; Incomplete Proof. The solution's central argument rests on the unproven assumption that g(x) must be a linear function. The argument to exclude non-linear solutions is asserted rather than demonstrated."
