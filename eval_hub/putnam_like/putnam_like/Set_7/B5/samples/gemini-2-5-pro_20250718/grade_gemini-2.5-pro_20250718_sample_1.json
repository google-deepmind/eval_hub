    "comment": "The solution is flawless. All required properties of the function g (injectivity, monotonicity, surjectivity) are correctly established. The case analysis based on monotonicity is sound and complete. The use of the associated recurrence relation to find the linear solutions in the decreasing case is particularly elegant. Both families of solutions are correctly identified and verified.",
