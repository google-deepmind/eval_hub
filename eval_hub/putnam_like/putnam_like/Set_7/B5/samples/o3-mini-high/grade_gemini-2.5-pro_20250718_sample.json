    "comment": "The student correctly identifies all affine solutions by assuming the form g(x) = ax+b and solving for the coefficients. The solutions found are also correctly verified. However, the solution completely fails to prove that there are no other non-affine continuous solutions, which is the main challenge of the problem. The rubric requires a rigorous proof of injectivity, monotonicity, and a case analysis to show that these are the only possible solutions, none of which is present in the student's work. The solution asserts that this can be shown without providing the argument. Partial credit is awarded for finding the correct functional forms and for the final verification.",
    "types_of_mistakes": "The primary error is a major logical gap: assuming the solution is an affine function without justification. This leads to an incomplete proof, as it fails to demonstrate that no other solutions exist."
