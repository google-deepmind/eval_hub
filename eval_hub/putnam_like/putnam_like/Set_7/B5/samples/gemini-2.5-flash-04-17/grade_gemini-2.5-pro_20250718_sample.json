    "comment": "The student provides a complete and rigorous solution. They correctly identify all solutions by first checking for linear functions and then proving that no other solutions exist. The proof is well-structured, correctly establishing injectivity and then analyzing the cases of a strictly increasing and strictly decreasing function. The arguments for both cases are sound and lead to the correct function families. The method used for the decreasing case differs from the rubric's but is equally valid and elegant.",
