    "comment": "The student correctly identified both families of linear solutions, g(x) = x and g(x) = -1/2 x + c, by assuming a linear form and solving for the coefficients. The verification of these solutions is also correct. However, the solution completely lacks a proof that these are the *only* continuous solutions. The argument in \"Step 4\" is insufficient and invalid, as it incorrectly assumes that any continuous solution must be differentiable and then provides no justification for why non-linear functions would be excluded. The core of the problem, which involves proving injectivity, monotonicity, and analyzing the resulting cases as outlined in the rubric, was not addressed. Points are awarded for finding and verifying the solutions, but the lack of a valid proof for completeness results in a low score.",
