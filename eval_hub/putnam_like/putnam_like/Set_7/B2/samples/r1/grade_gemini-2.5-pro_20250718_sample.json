    "comment": "The solution is flawless. It correctly establishes the upper bound of 1 using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It then successfully constructs a valid sequence of functions and calculates the limit of the ratio of their L1 and L2 norms, proving that the supremum is 1. The calculations are accurate and the reasoning is sound.",
