    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly applies the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to establish an upper bound of 1 for the supremum. They then provide a valid sequence of functions from the specified class and correctly compute the limit of the ratio, demonstrating that the supremum is indeed 1. The additional analysis of the equality case and the presentation of a second, alternative sequence are signs of a very strong understanding of the material.",
