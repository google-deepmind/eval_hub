    "comment": "The solution is excellent. The upper bound of 1 is correctly established using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. A valid sequence of functions in the given space is constructed to demonstrate that this upper bound is indeed the supremum. All calculations for the integrals and the final limit are correct and clearly presented.",
