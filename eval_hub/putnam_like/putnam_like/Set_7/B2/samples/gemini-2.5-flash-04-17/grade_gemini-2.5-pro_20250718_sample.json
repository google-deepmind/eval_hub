    "comment": "The student correctly calculates the ratio for a valid test function, f(x) = sqrt(x), establishing a lower bound of 2*sqrt(2)/3 for the supremum. However, the remainder of the solution is fundamentally flawed. The student incorrectly asserts that this lower bound is also an upper bound by citing a non-existent inequality, leading to an incorrect final answer. The solution misses the correct approach of using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find the upper bound of 1 and constructing a sequence of functions to show this supremum is achieved in the limit.",
