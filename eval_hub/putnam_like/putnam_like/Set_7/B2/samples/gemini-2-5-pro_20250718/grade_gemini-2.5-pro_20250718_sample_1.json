    "comment": "The solution is flawless. The student correctly established an upper bound of 1 using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. A valid sequence of functions was constructed to demonstrate that this upper bound is the supremum. All calculations are accurate and the logical flow is clear and correct. The chosen sequence, while different from the canonical example in the rubric, is perfectly valid and handled correctly.",
