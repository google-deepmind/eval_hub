# A set of Putnam-like problems

Welcome to Putnam-like, a benchmark crafted to probe the boundaries of
mathematical reasoning in sophisticated AI systems. This collection offers
university-level mathematical challenges, echoing the spirit of the Putnam
Competition and similar student contests. These problems are intended to assess
the depths of mathematical understanding, moving beyond superficial mathematical
mimicry to demand a more profound and adaptable form of abstract thinking.

The problem selection mirrors the easier and medium-difficulty tiers of the
Putnam Competition. While the problems are arranged in sets of 12, reminiscent
of the actual competition, we estimate that problems $A5, A6, B5, B6$ in this
dataset are generally less demanding than their counterparts in the official
Putnam exams.

Our main goal is not just to present difficult questions but also to facilitate
a thorough analysis of AI capabilities. The problems are grouped into sets, with
each entry containing:

*   **Problem Statement:** A question from domains such as algebra, analysis,
    number theory, and combinatorics.
*   **Corresponding Lean Statement:** A formal representation of the Problem
    Statement.
*   **A Grading Rubric:** A detailed solution, with points assigned to crucial
    insights and calculations, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of a model's
    reasoning.
*   **A Grade Summary:** A compilation of performance data from various AI
    models, offering a comparative perspective on their problem-solving skills
    as judged by both human and AI evaluators.

Variants of these problems in the formal language Lean can be found at

#### **Problem Curation and Expert Collaboration**

The problems in this dataset were authored by a team of four mathematicians from
Nicolaus Copernicus University, a group whose interconnected careers in
research, mentorship, and education form a powerful ecosystem for cultivating
mathematical talent. Their collective expertise, spanning elite university
competitions to foundational outreach, was instrumental in the creation of this
comprehensive and challenging problem set. The Lean formalizations were provided
by top experts in the field.

To ensure the highest quality and originality, these problems were
**commissioned through a formal consulting engagement**. The experts were
compensated for their time, creativity, and deep subject matter expertise. This
approach was chosen to ensure the problems are not only demanding but also
mathematically rigorous, subtle, and accurately reflect the sophisticated
reasoning abilities we seek to evaluate.

#### **Known Issues and Future Plans**

We expect that this dataset may contain up to 10% of noisy samples, including
typos, ambiguities, or conceptual errors in the solutions, which we plan to
address in subsequent releases. The percentage of errors may be higher in the
case of Lean formalizations. In future releases, we are also planning to include
solve rates for leading formal theorem proving systems. In our evaluations, we
are not using any particular inference techniques or dedicated prompting, with
the expectation that the model should provide a consistent solution given only
the math problem as the input. This may limit the performance of some models,
and we are not excluding the use of more elaborate inference and prompting
methods in future releases.
