Clearly we can look at this situation as if it was a matrix filled with positive real numbers. Because of the condition about the weights, the smallest and biggest values in any column cannot differ by more than 1. Notice that if each value that is not the biggest and not the smallest in its column is changed to be equal to either the smallest or the biggest value in its column (arbitrarily), this does not change that the condition $|x_{i}-y_{i}| = 1$ still holds. But after such a change, for
any choice of what the smallest and biggest values in each column are, there are only two possible choices for each entry in the matrix (either the smallest or the biggest value in its column); that is, only $2^5 = 32$ possible distinct rows, and the given property implies also that all rows must be distinct. This number indeed can be achieved, just consider all 0-1 vectors.\\
