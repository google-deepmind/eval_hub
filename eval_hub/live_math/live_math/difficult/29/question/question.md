 The miller fills bags with flour (he has an infinite amount at his disposal). He wants to arrange these bags in 5 columns and $n$ rows in such a way that for any 2 different rows $[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5]$ and $[y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5]$ it holds that
    \begin{align*}
        \max(|x_1 - y_1|, |x_2 - y_2|, |x_3 - y_3|, |x_4 - y_4|, |x_5 - y_5|) = 1.
    \end{align*}
    where $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5$ are the weights of the bags in these rows. What is the maximum possible number of rows in which the miller can arrange the bags to satisfy this condition?
