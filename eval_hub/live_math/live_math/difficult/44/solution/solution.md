Notice that if we take base as $n-1$, then $n$ is expressed as $11_{n-1}$. Then we need to find the other two bases that $n$ is repeating ones in that base. We need a solution for some equation in the form $a^k+a^{k-1}+...+a+1=b^l+b^{l-1}+...+l+1$ for some bases $a, b$. $k, l$ are lengths of the respective representations of $n$ in bases $a,b$. By examining numbers we can find that if $n=31$, then $n=11111_2$, and $n=111_5$. 31 is the lowest one, because if $n=11_{(b)}=b+1$ and $n=111_{(c)}=c^2+c+1$ we have that $b=c(c+1)$. If we could have $n=1111_{(d)}$ we would have $n=d^3+d^2+d+1$ so $c^2+c=d^3+d^2+d$ so $(c+d+1)(c-d)=d^3$ and it is clear that $GCD(c,d)=1$ (dividing by a common factor, it should divide number $1$). However, it is clear from $c^2+c=d^3+d^2+d$ that at left the term is even and at right the term should be odd so there is no solution. Hence, we consider $11111_{e}$ and we need $c(c+1)=e^4+e^3+e^2+e+1$ and checking we find that the lowest solution is given by $(c,e)=(5,2)$.
