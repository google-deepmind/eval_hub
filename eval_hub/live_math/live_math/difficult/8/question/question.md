There is a country with 20 towns. We can travel between any pair of towns by exactly one type of transport. We go on a round-trip if we start at home, then travel to another town for work. After that, we travel to a town different from the previous two towns for vacation, and in the end, we return back home. A round-trip is easy if we use at most two different types of transport. What is the maximum possible number of different transportation types in the country such that any round-trip is easy?
