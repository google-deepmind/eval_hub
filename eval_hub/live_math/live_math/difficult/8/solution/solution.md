We can represent the country as a complete graph with colored edges. We want to use as many colors as possible, while not having a rainbow triangle. To use 19 colors without a rainbow triangle we can order all 20 points. Then color all edges adjacent to the first point by the first color. After color all uncolored edges adjacent to the second point by the second color and so on. Then if we choose any three points and look at the lowest point in the ordering, then the two edges incident to it will be of the same color. To prove the upper bound denote by $e(G)$ the number of edges and by $c(G)$ the number of colors in $G$. Then we can prove if $e(G) + c(G) \geq n(n + 1)/2$, then we have a rainbow triangle. The proof is by contradiction. We assume the minimal counter-example $G$. The proof follows from the series of claims. 1. $G$ contains two edges with the same color. 2. $e(G) + c(G) = n(n + 1)/2$. 3. $d(v) + d^s(v) \geq n + 1$, for every $v \in V (G)$, where $d(v)$ is the degree of vertex $v$, and $d^s(v)$ is the number of colors that every edge of that color is incident to vertex $v$. 4. $\sum_{v\in V(G)} ds(v) \leq 2c(G)$, and the equality holds if and only if every two edges have distinct colors. Full proof can be found in Rainbow triangles in edge-colored graphs (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566981300231X).
