Company sells one liter of water for $\frac{2}{7}$ dollars and one liter of coffee for $\frac{10}{13}$ dollars. We can buy any amount of liquids (not necessarily integer amounts), but at most 35 liters of water and at most 13 liters of coffee. Let $D$ be the amount of dollars we paid, and $W$ and $C$ be the amounts of water and coffee we bought. We want $D$ and $W+C$ to be integers. How many different pairs $(D, W+C)$ is it possible to obtain?
