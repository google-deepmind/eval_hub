If we fix some integer amount $x$ of dollars we want to pay, then we can buy at least $\frac{13}{10}x$ liters of liquid and at most $\frac{7}{2}x$. Notice that any convex combination of these two values that is an integer is a solution. Therefore if we draw a parallelogram with points $(0,0), (10,13), (10,35), (20, 48)$ denoting the feasible region, to get the solution we need to count points with integer coordinates inside or on the boundary of the triangle. To count points inside the triangle we can use Pick's formula because the area of the parallelogram is $220$. There are $2 \cdot 6$ points with integer coordinates on the boundary. Then there are 215 points with integer coordinates inside the triangle. In total, the answer is $215+12=227$.
