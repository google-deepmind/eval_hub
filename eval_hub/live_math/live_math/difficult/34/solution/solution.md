Using the identity $abcd = 1$, we substitute $ad = x$ and $bc = \frac{1}{x}$. The expression becomes $(a + d)(1 + \frac{1}{x}) + (b + c)(1 + x)$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $a + d \geq 2\sqrt{ad} = 2\sqrt{x}$ and $b + c \geq 2\sqrt{bc} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}$. So the expression is at least $2\sqrt{x}(1 + \frac{1}{x}) + \frac{2}{\sqrt{x}}(1 + x) = 4(\sqrt{x} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}})$, which is minimized when $x = 1$, giving the minimal value 8.
