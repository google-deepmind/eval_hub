Anna, Ben, Celine, Dan, Ellie and Frank went to the theater. They booked 6 consecutive seats. Unfortunately, Dan had an argument with Frank just before the play, and they didn't want to sit next to each other. Anna and Ben are a couple and they wanted to have two consecutive places. Celine wishes not to sit on the first or last seat. How many different arrangements of the seats are there?
