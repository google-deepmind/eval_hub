We begin by treating Anna and Ben as a single block (which can be either AB or BA), reducing the problem to arranging 5 elements. There are $5! = 120$ ways to arrange these blocks, and $2$ internal arrangements of the AB block, giving $5! \cdot 2 = 240$ total arrangements where A and B sit together. Next, we subtract the arrangements where Dan and Frank sit together. Treating D and F as a block (with 2 internal arrangements), we now have 4 blocks to permute: AB, DF, C, and E. This gives $4! \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 96$ arrangements where both A&B and D&F sit together. Thus, the number of arrangements where A&B are together and D&F are apart is $240 - 96 = 144$. Finally, we account for Celine’s restriction: she must not be seated at position 1 or 6. Among the 144 valid arrangements so far, exactly 48 place C at one of the ends. Therefore, the final number of valid arrangements satisfying all three conditions is $144 - 48 = 96$.
