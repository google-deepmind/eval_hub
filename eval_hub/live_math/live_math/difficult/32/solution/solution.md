Notice that the polynomial $Q(x)=P(x)-2$ satisfies $Q(a)=Q(a+1)=Q(a+2)=0$ so this polynomial can be rewritten as $Q(x)=(x-a)(x-a-1)(x-a-2) \cdot R(x)$ where $R(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients (or an integer constant). If $P(k)=n$ for $n > 2$ then $Q(k)=n-2 \neq 0$ so it is clear that $n-2$ must be the product of at least three non-zero consecutive integers. Bearing in mind that $0 < n-2 < 98$ the only possibilities for $n-2$ could be to be a multiple of $6= 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$, a multiple of $24= 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4$ or a multiple of $60=3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$ since the following one would be $120$. It is not necessary to consider negative values since the product of three negative values is negative and if one of them is $0$, then the product is also $0$. Hence we obtain that $n$ must be necessarily $n=6k+2$ for some positive integer $k$ such that $2 < 6k+2 < 100$ so $1 \leq k \leq 16$. Notice that polynomial $P(x)=x^3-x+2$ satisfies $P(-1)=P(0)=P(1)=2$ and $P(2)=8$. The polynomial $P(x)=k(x^3-x)+2$ also satisfies $P(-1)=P(0)=P(1)=2$ and $P(2)=6k+2$ as we wanted so the solution is given by $16$.
