We place the balls numbered from 1 to 10 into 10 boxes, each also labeled from 1 to 10, so that every box contains exactly one ball -- that is, we form a permutation of the set $\{1, 2, \dots, 10\}$, where ball number $\sigma(i)$ is placed in box number $i$.
In how many such permutations does there exist a sequence of six distinct box numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_6$ such that:
$\sigma(a_1) = a_2,\ \sigma(a_2) = a_3,\ \dots,\ \sigma(a_5) = a_6,\ \sigma(a_6) = a_1?$
(In other words, the values of the permutation form a 6-cycle on the positions $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_6$.)
