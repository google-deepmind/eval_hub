Let us prove the following theorem. The number of permutations of an $n$-element set that contain a cycle of length $k > \frac{n}{2}$ in their cycle decomposition is: $\frac{n!}{k}.$ \textit{Proof.} We first choose, in $\binom{n}{k}$ ways, which $k$ elements will form the cycle. These elements can be arranged in $k!$ ways. However, a cycle remains the same under cyclic shifts. For instance, the 3-cycle $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ is equivalent to $(a_2, a_3, a_1)$ or $(a_3, a_1, a_2)$. There are $k$ such cyclic shifts, so each distinct cycle is counted $k$ times. Therefore, the number of distinct cycles on these $k$ elements is $\frac{k!}{k} = (k-1)!$. The remaining $n - k$ elements can be permuted arbitrarily -- that's $(n - k)!$ permutations. Each such full permutation is uniquely determined by placing this cycle among the rest of the permutation. Thus, the total number of permutations of an $n$-element set that contain a cycle of length $k > \frac{n}{2}$ is: $\binom{n}{k} \cdot (k - 1)! \cdot (n - k)! = \frac{n!}{k}.$. Using this theorem for $n=10$ and $k=6$ we obtain the desired result.
