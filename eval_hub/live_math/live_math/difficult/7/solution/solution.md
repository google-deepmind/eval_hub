Each number $c_i$ has to be an integer with an absolute value at most 1. $c_0$ can be either 0 or 1. Also notice that at most $1$ of the other $c_1$ is non-zero, because otherwise there is such assignment of variables that breaks out of the range for $f$. If $c_0$ is 0, we can set any of the other $c_i$ to one and the rest to 0. There are 10 such options. There is also an option where all $c_i$ are zero. If $c_0$ is 1, then we can set some other $c_1$ to -1 in this case. Then we obtain the symmetric solution. Therefore we get $2(10 + 1) = 22$ possible functions $f$.
