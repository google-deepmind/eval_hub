There is a grid of size 10x10. One of the cells is chosen uniformly at random. The choice of this cell is secret. You can ask for any cell $(x,y)$ of the grid, what is the Manhattan distance of the cell $(x,y)$ from the secretly chosen one. What is the expected number of questions you need to ask to find a secret cell if you ask optimally? Write the answer as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the result irreducible fraction.
