With 2 questions it is always possible. For example first could be about the upper left corner cell and the second could be about the lower left corner cell. The answers to these two questions uniquely determine the treasure's location. This is the optimal strategy, because by the first question if we ask for any cell we determine at most 2 cells (if we ask for the upper left corner, the cell is determined if the answer is 0 or 18), and if we do not manage to determine it with one question then 2 are always sufficient. Therefore we get $2 \cdot \frac{98}{100} + 1 \cdot \frac{2}{100} = \frac{99}{50}$.
