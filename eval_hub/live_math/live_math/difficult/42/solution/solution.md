For $a=b=c=d=e=7$ we have $abcde = 7^5 = 16807$. In general, by Fermat's little theorem
 $$a^6 \equiv 1\pmod{7}$$
 if $a$ is not divisible by $7$. One then sees that for $a^6+b^6+c^6+d^6+e^6$ to be divisible by $7$, one needs to have all five numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$ divisible by $7$. Hence the product is divisible by $16807$.
