Notice that in any $2\times 2$ square we can have at most one king -- any two kings in such a square attach each other. Notice that the answer will not be higher than for the $316\times 514$ chessboard. That one we can cut into $158\cdot 257 = 40606$ squares of dimensions $2\times 2$, hence we cannot place more than $40606$ kings. We show that it is possible to lay out exactly that number of kings on the chessboard. Let us introduce the coordinates, where the rows are numbered from $0$ to $314$ and the columns are numbered from $0$ to $514$. If we put the kings only on the squares with two even coordinates, no two of them will attack each other, and there will be exactly $158\cdot 257$ of them.
