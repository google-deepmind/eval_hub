From the problem statement, we can form a poset on the integers from 1 to 200. Where $a\leq b$ if there exist $x, y$ such that $a\cdot 2^x \cdot 2^y = b$. From Dilworth's we know that the answer is the maximum size on the antichain (antichain is where no elements are comparable). We can see that any two numbers bigger than 100 are not comparable. That is because the numbers in the chain at least double each time. It turns out the answer is 100. We can construct chains by taking all odd numbers as the starting points, and each even number $2k$ is added to the chain after the number $k$.
