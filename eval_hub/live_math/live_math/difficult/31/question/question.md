There are several persons on the playground. They are playing a game with candies according to the following rules. If person A has $x > 1$ candies, he will choose two friends B and, C (that did not receive any candies yet), and give $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$ candies to B and $\lceil x/2 \rceil$ candies to C. If person A has just 1 candy, he will eat it. At the beginning of the game, one person has 1000 candies and all the other persons have 0 candies. Let $d$ denote the maximum number of times some candy was given to someone until it was eaten. How many candies were given exactly $d$ times until eaten?
