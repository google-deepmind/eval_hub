Firstly, notice we can send candies in steps. In each step, every person who has some candies will send them at the same time. For example, in the first step first person sends candies to two friends. In the second step, these two friends choose two friends each (in total 4 people) and send their candies. In the third step, 4 people with candies repeat the procedure, and so on. During each iteration, there are at most 2 different numbers of candies that people have. Moreover, these numbers differ by exactly one. Since $512$ is the largest power of 2 smaller than $1000$, some candy will be passed exactly 9 times before being eaten. If we look at the 9th iteration, there are some people that have one candy and some people with 2 candies. Thus, exactly $(1000 - 512)$ people have two candeis. These are the candies that will be eaten after 10 passes, which is the maximum. To get the answer, we take $2 \cdot (1000 - 512)$.
