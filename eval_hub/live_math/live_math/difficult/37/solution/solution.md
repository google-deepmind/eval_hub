We know that the polynomial $P(x)-2024$ can be expressed as follows.
        \begin{align*}
            P(x) - 2024 = (x-a)(x-a-10)\cdot Q(x),
        \end{align*}
        where $Q(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Suppose that $c$ is the solution of the equation $P(c) = 2031$. Then we would have
        \begin{align*}
            7 = (c-a)(c-a-10)\cdot Q(c),
        \end{align*}
        so 7 would be expressed as a product of three terms. $c-a$ and $c-a-10$ are clearly different numbers (and $c-a > c-a-10$), and 7 is prime, thus we need to have
        $c-a = 7$ and $c-a-10 = 1$ or $c-a = -1$ and $c-a-10 = -7$. None of these systems of equations have any solutions. Thus there are 0 integer solutions of the equation $P(x) = 2031$.
