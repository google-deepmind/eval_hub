We can draw the lines so that no three intersect at one point. In that case, any four of the drawn lines, where two, but not three, of them are parallel, give rise to exactly one trapezoid. We can either choose two of Marc's lines and then any pair of lines from Barbara's and Ali's set, or two of Barbara's lines and then any pair of lines from Marc's and Ali's set, or two of Ali's lines and then any pair of lines from Marc's and Barbara's set. This gives in total
 $$\binom{3}{2} \cdot \binom{4+5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{3+5}{2} + \binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom {3+4}{2} = 3\cdot 36 + 6 \cdot 28 + 10 \cdot 21 = 108 + 168 + 210 = 486.$$
 
However, we have counted the parallelograms twice. Their number is
$$\binom{3}{2}\cdot \binom{4}{2} + \binom{3}{2}\cdot \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{5}{2} = 3\cdot 6 + 3\cdot 10 + 6\cdot 10 = 108. $$


Hence the number of trapezoids is
$$486 - 108 = 378.$$
