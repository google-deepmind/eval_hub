Note that from the conditions the triangles $ABC$ nd $ADC$ are congruent right triangles, with the right angles at the vertices $B$ and $D$. Hence we have 
$$\angle PBQ = \angle PBM + \angle MBQ = 2\angle ABM + 2\angle MBC = 2\angle ABC = 180^\circ.$$
Therefore the point $B$ lies on the segment $PQ$. Moreover, $BP = BQ = BM$, as $P$ and $Q$ are reflections of $M$ along lines containing $B$. Therefore we have $PQ = 2 BM = 41$. By symmetry, we also have $RS = 41$.


Now let $S$ be the projection of $M$ on the line $AB$. The triangle $ASM$ is then homothetic to the triangle $ABC$ in $A$, in scale $\frac{1}{2}$. Hence the distance of $M$ from the line $AC$ is half the distance of $B$ from the line $AC$. Therefore the distance of $P$ from the line $AC$ is the same as that of the point $B$. The same reasoning shows that $Q$ is also at the same distance from $AC$. Therefore the line $PQ$ is actually parallel to $AC$. By symmetry, so is the line $RS$ and the lines $QR$ and $SP$ are both perpendicular to $AC$. Therefore $PQRS$ is actually a rectangle. We have already computed $PQ = 41$. We only need to compute $QR$ to compute the area. We see it is equal to twice the distance of $B$ from $AC$. That distance is equal to
$$\frac{9\cdot 40}{41}.$$
Therefore $QR = \frac{2\cdot 9\cdot 40}{41}$.
Hence the area of the rectangle is 
$$41\cdot \frac{2\cdot 9\cdot 40}{41} = 720.$$
