Let us first assume that $a_1$ is the largest term in the sequence. We have $a_1|a_{360}+1$. As $a_1 \neq a_{360}$, if $a_1 < a_{360}+1$, we will have $a_1 < a_{360}$, which contradicts our assumption. Hence $a_{360} = a_1-1$. Then we have $a_{360}|a_{359}+1$, hence $a_{359} \ge a_{360}-1$. If the inequality is strict, we have $a_{359}\ge a_{360}$. However as all the terms are pairwise distinct, we cannot have $a_{359} = a_{360}$ and we cannot have $a_{359} = a_{360}+1 = a_{1}$. Then we would have $a_{359} > a_1$, which is a contradiction. Hence we get $a_{359} = a_{360}-1 = a_1 - 2$.
 
Inductive reasoning shows that $a_{358} = a_1 - 3$, $a_{357} = a_1 - 4$, \dots, $a_2 = a_1 - 359$. We have $a_2 | a_1 + 1$, so $a_1-359|a_1 +1$. This is equivalent to $a_1-359|360$. Note that $a_1-359$ has to be positive, as it is equal to $a_2$. It must be then a positive divisor of $360$. As $360 = 2^3\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$, there are 24 divisors to choose from. Each of them produces a valid sequence, with $a_1$ being the largest. Hence we counted the sequences under the assumption of $a_1$ being the largest. We can perform a cyclic translation of any sequence to get all the other possible sequences. As the terms in the sequences are pairwise distinct, no two sequences will be repeated. Hence the total number of admissible sequences is $360\cdot 24 = 8640$.
