Let's draw a line through point $C$ parallel to $AB$. Let the intersection point with line $l$ be denoted by $A'$, and the intersection point with line $k$ be denoted by $B'$. Let the angles that the external angle bisector at $A$ divides the external angle into, be denoted by $\alpha$. Then $ |\angle AA'C| = \alpha $, because $ AB \parallel A'B'$. Similarly, let the angles that the external angle bisector at $B$ divides the external angle into, be denoted by $\beta$. Then, similarly to before, $ |\angle CB'B| = \beta $. Therefore, triangles $ACA'$ and $CBB'$ are isosceles, and $X$ and $Y$ are the feet of the altitudes in these triangles, respectively. Thus, they bisect the sides $AA'$ and $BB'$ at their midpoints. The quadrilateral $ABB'A'$ is a trapezoid, so by a known fact $|XY| = \frac{1}{2}\cdot (|A'B'| + |AB|) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot(|AC| + |BC| + |AB|) = \frac{1}{2}\cdot(12 + 14 + 10) = 18$.
