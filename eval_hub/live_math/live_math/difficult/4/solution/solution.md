Without loss of generality we can assume that the vertices of hexagons are labeled counterclockwise. Note that $C_1$ is the image of $B_1$ under a spiral similarity, centered in $A$, with the angle $30^\circ$ and scale $\sqrt{3}$. As the analogous statements are true for $C_2$ and $C_3$, we have that the triangle $C_1C_2C_3$ is similar to the triangle $B_1B_2B_3$ with the scale $\sqrt{3}$. Hence its area is three times larger. Analogously $E_1E_2E_3$ will have the same area. The triangle $D_1D_2D_3$ is then similar to $A_1A_2A_3$ with the scale $2$, hence its area is 4 times the area of $A_1A_2A_3$. The triangle $F_1F_2F_3$ is congruent to the triangle $A_1A_2A_3$. Hence the sum of all the requested areas is
 
 $$3\cdot 17 + 4\cdot 17 + 3\cdot 17 + 17 = 11\cdot 17 = 187.$$
