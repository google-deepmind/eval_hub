The circles $o_1$ and $o_2$ intersect in two points, $A$ and $B$. A point X lies on the line $AB$ and is outside of the both circles. A line $k$ contains the point $X$ and intersects $o_1$ in two points $K$ and $L$. A line $l$ contains the point $X$ and intersects $o_2$ in two points $M$ and $N$. Given $XK = 12$, $XM = 13$, $MN = 47$, find the ratio of the areas of the quadrilateral $KLNM$ and the triangle $XKM$.
