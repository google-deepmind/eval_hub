We claim that each switched has to be used at least once. Number the switches from $1$ to $100$ (going around the circle) and let $x_i$ be the number of times we used switch $i$. Then from the conditions we have that $x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2}$ is odd for $i=1,2,\dots, 100$ (we let $x_{101} = x_1$ and $x_{102} = x_2$). Subtracting two such equations for $i$ and $i+1$ gives that $x_i - x_{i+3}$ is even. This means that $x_1$, $x_4$, $x_7$, $x_{10}$ \dots, $x_{100}$ all have the same parity. Going around again, we get that this equals the parity of $x_3$, $x_6$, \dots, $x_{99}$ and then one more turn gives equality with the parity of $x_2$, $x_5$, \dots, $x_{98}$. Hence all $x_i$ have the same parity. If they are all even, then none of the sums $x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2}$ will be odd. Hence all $x_i$'s are odd. This means that they are all greater than or equal $1$.
