The condition that either the first or last card is not chosen enables us to consider this situation on the circle where no two adjacent cards can be chosen. On the circle, each card is chosen in the same amount of possibilities since it is symmetric. To count the number of options to choose 7 cards, we can either choose the first one (and not the second and the last one) and then choose the other 6 where no two are next to each other with $22 \choose 6$ or do not take the first one and choose only the others with $23 \choose 7$ options. In the end, we just multiply the number of options by 7 and divide by 30 to account for each card.
