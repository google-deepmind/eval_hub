Let $m$ be a positive integer and $f(x)=x^{-1/m}$ a function. Consider a point $P$ on the graph of $f$ and $t$ the tangent line passing through $P$ which intersects the $OX$ axis at $A$ and the $OY$ axis at $B$ where $O=(0,0)$. The triangle $ABO$ is rotated around the $OX$ axis generating a cone. Calculate the value of $m$ such that the volume of the cone is independent of the point $P$.
