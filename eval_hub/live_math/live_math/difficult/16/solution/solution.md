We will denote $r=-1/m$ for some $r < 0$. Since $f'(x)=r x^{r-1}$ we have that for any point $P(x_0,x_0^r)$ the tangent line is given by:
$$y=x_0^r+r x_0^{r-1}(x-x_0)$$
\noindent so for $x=0$ we obtain $y=(1-r) x_0^r$ and hence the point $B$ is given by $B(0,(1-r) x_0^r)$. If $y=0$ then $(1-r)x_0^r+ r x_0^{r-1}x=0$ so $(1-r) x_0+r x =0$ and we obtain $x=-(1-r)x_0/r$ so $A(-(1-r)x_0/r,0)$. The volume of the cone will be given by $1/3 \cdot (2 OB)^2 OA$ so if we want it to be independent of $P$, it is enough to have that $OB^2 \cdot OA$ is independent of $x_0$. We have:
$$OB^2 \cdot OA = (1-r)^2 x_0^{2r} \cdot \frac{-(1-r)}{r} x_0$$
\noindent so we need that $2r+1=0$ and hence $r=-1/2$ and hence $m=2$.
