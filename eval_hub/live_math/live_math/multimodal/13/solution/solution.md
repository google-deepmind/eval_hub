Let $0 \in S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a subsemigroup with $g(S):=\#(\mathbb{N} \backslash S)<\infty$. In this case the tree $T(S)$ determines the number $g(S)$ via the formula
$$
g(S)=\#\{v \in V \mid \chi(v) \leq 0\}-1
$$

If $S$ also satisfies the additional property that $S \cap(m(S), 2 m(S)) \leq 1$ where $m(S):=\min (S \backslash\{0\})$ then $T(S)$ also determines $m(S)$ as follows: if $\min \chi<0$ then
$$
m(S)=2-\max \{n<0 \mid T(S) \text { has a leaf } v \text { with } \chi(v)=n\}
$$

The proof of both of these statements is a bit too long to write here, but I'm happy to provide references.

Assume that $0<A<B$ are coprime integers. In the case of a semigroup $S=A \mathbb{N}+B \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ we have that $m(S)=A$ and it is a classical theorem that $g(S)=\frac{1}{2}(A-1)(B-1)$.

It follows that in our case $A=2-(-6)=8$ and $g(S)=28=\frac{1}{2}(8-1)(B-1)$ whence $B=9$ and thus $A+B=17$.
