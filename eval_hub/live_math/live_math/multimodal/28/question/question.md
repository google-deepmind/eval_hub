Consider the three-dimensional solid polyhedron depicted. It has two red, two green, and two blue rectangular faces, and two hexagonal grey faces on the top and bottom. Let $X$ be the 3-dimensional CW complex obtained by identifying faces of the same color according to the orientations of the arrows on their boundaries. Let $V_H$ be the number of vertices on a hexagonal face and $V_R$ be the number of vertices on a rectangular face. Compute the number $(V_H-1)(V_R-1) + \tau(X)$, where $\tau(X)$ denotes the order of the torsion part of the total homology group $H_*(X)$.
