Numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 25$ are randomly placed in the squares shown in the figure. Every permutation of the numbers has the same probability of occurring. Next to every row, the maximum of the numbers placed in that row is written. The probability that the numbers written next to the figure are increasing downwards, is a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers. Determine $q-p$.
