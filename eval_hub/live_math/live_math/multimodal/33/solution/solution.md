The hexagon is composed of a grid of equilateral triangles of unit side length, arranged in 2 rows and 9 columns. This makes for a total of $2 \times 9 = 18$ triangles. The rhombi used for the tessellation are each composed of two adjacent equilateral triangles. Therefore, to tessellate the entire hexagon, we need $18 / 2 = 9$ rhombi.

The rhombi can be placed in different orientations. Let's consider a 'vertical' orientation, where the rhombus is formed by an upper triangle and a lower triangle sharing a horizontal edge. Such a rhombus spans the full height of the hexagon.

The provided solution is based on the argument that each possible tessellation is uniquely determined by the position of a single vertical rhombus. Once a vertical rhombus is placed in one of the 9 possible columns, the argument asserts that the remaining rhombi must all be placed 'horizontally' (i.e., formed by two adjacent triangles within the same row), which uniquely determines the rest of the tiling.

There are 9 columns in the hexagon grid. A vertical rhombus can be placed in any of these 9 columns. For example, if we place a vertical rhombus in the first column, the remaining 8 columns (16 triangles) must be tiled. The asserted unique way to do this is to form 4 horizontal rhombi in the top row and 4 horizontal rhombi in the bottom row.

Since there are 9 possible positions to place the defining vertical rhombus, and each choice corresponds to a unique tiling, the total number of ways to tessellate the figure is 9.
