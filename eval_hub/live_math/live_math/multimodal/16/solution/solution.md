The complete graph $K_{5}$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of 6 circles, hence any subgraph of $K_{5}$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of $\leq 6$ circles. In other words any simple graph on $\leq 5$ vertices is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of $\leq 6$ circles.

The surface $S$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of 10 circles which is homotopy equivalent to $K_{6}$, whence $n \leq 6$. By the previous paragraph on the other hand, the wedge of 10 circles cannot be homotopy equivalent to a simple graph on 5 vertices, so $n \geq 6$.
