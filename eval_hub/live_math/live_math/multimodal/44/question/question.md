An equilateral triangle of side length $a$ is given. We draw a circle in it as in the first figure below. Then we draw three circles as in the second figure, and we continue following this pattern. At each step, the circles are mutually tangent as shown in the picture, and the external ones are tangent to the triangle sides. All the circles drawn at the same step are congruent. At the $n$-th step each side of the triangle is tangent to $n$ circles. Let $S_n$ be the total area of the circles drawn in the $n$-th step. Determine

$$A = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{S_n}{a^2}.$$

As the answer, report $10000A$ rounded to the nearest integer.
