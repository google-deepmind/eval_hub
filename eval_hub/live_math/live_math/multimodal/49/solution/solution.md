Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the commutative monoid of closed surfaces under the connected sum operation ($\#$). By the classification theorem for closed surfaces, any element of $\mathcal{S}$ is homeomorphic to a connected sum of tori ($S^1 \times S^1$) and/or real projective planes ($\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$). The identity element is the sphere $S^2$.

The monoid is generated by the torus $T = S^1 \times S^1$ and the projective plane $P = \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$. There is a fundamental relation between these generators: $P \# P \# P \cong T \# P$.

We form the Grothendieck group $A(\mathcal{S})$. Let $[M]$ denote the class of a surface $M$ in $A(\mathcal{S})$. The operation $\#$ becomes addition in the group. The relation becomes $3[P] = [T] + [P]$, which simplifies to $[T] = 2[P]$.

This means that the class of any surface can be expressed as an integer multiple of $[P]$. Therefore, the Grothendieck group $A(\mathcal{S})$ is isomorphic to the group of integers $\mathbb{Z}$. We can establish this isomorphism by setting $[S^2] = 0$ and $[P] = [\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2] = 1$. Consequently, $[T] = [S^1 \times S^1] = 2$.

The surfaces $X$ and $Y$ are defined by the diagrams. We interpret them as follows:

- The diagram for $X$ shows a connected sum of three surfaces. The first is a Klein bottle ($K = \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2 \# \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$), the second is a connected sum of 6 tori ($\#^6 T$), and the third is a connected sum of 4 tori and a Klein bottle ($( \#^4 T) \# K$). So, $X = K \# (\#^6 T) \# ((\#^4 T) \# K) = (\#^2 P) \# (\#^6 T) \# ((\#^4 T) \# (\#^2 P))$.

- The diagram for $Y$ shows a connected sum of a Klein bottle and a projective plane. So, $Y = K \# P = (\#^2 P) \# P = \#^3 P$.

Now we compute the values of $[X]$ and $[Y]$ in $A(\mathcal{S}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$:

$$ [X] = [\#^2 P] + [\#^6 T] + [\#^4 T] + [\#^2 P] = 4[P] + 10[T] $$

Substituting $[P]=1$ and $[T]=2$:

$$ [X] = 4(1) + 10(2) = 4 + 20 = 24 $$

For $Y$:

$$ [Y] = [\#^3 P] = 3[P] = 3(1) = 3 $$

The group $G$ is the quotient group $G = A(\mathcal{S}) / \langle X \rangle$. Under our isomorphism, this corresponds to $\mathbb{Z} / \langle 24 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_{24}$. We need to find the order of the element $Y$ in $G$, which corresponds to finding the order of the element 3 in $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$.

The order of an element $k$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is given by the formula $\text{ord}(k) = n / \gcd(n, k)$.

For $k=3$ and $n=24$:

$$ \text{ord}(3) = 24 / \gcd(24, 3) = 24 / 3 = 8 $$

Thus, the order of the element $Y$ in $G$ is 8.
