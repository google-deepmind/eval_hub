Let the square based pyramid $ABCDE$ have vertices with coordinates $A(0,0,0)$, $B(4,0,0)$, $C(4,4,0)$, $D(0,4,0)$, and apex $E(2,2,3)$. First, we consider the object obtained from cutting the pyramid with the plane passing through $B$, $C$, and the midpoint of the edge $AE$, and discarding the top part. Then, we cut the remaining volume with the plane passing through $D$, $E$, and the midpoint of the edge $BC$, and discarding the section of least volume. Find the volume of the remaining object.
