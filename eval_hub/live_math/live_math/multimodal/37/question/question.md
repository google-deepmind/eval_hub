There is an an $8x8$ grid consisting of colored cubes. In one operation we can take the top row and move it such that it becomes the bottom row (we do not change the order of the cubes in the row). Similarly in one operation we can take the leftmost column and move it such that it becomes the rightmost column. Calculate the number of different color patterns we can obtain by performing the operations any number of times, such that in the top-left position is a blue cube.
