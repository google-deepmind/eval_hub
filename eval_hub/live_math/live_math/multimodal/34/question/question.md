There is a graph in the picture. In one operation you choose a vertex $v$ from the graph and a non-negative integer $k$. Then you color all the vertices at the distance $k$ and $k+1$ from the vertex $v$. What is the minimum number of operations needed to color all the vertices? (vertex $u$ is at distance $k$ from the vertex $v$, if the shortest path between $u$ and $v$ has $k$ edges)
