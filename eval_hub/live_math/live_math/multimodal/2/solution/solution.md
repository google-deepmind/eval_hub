We perform a rotation of $\triangle DMC$ by $90^\circ$ counter-clockwise around the center $D$. Since $ABCD$ is a square, point $C$ maps to point $A$. Let the image of point $M$ be $M'$.

From the properties of rotation, we have:
1.  Distances from the center of rotation are preserved, so $DM' = DM = 4$.
2.  The angle of rotation is $\angle M'DM = 90^\circ$.
3.  Distances between any two points are preserved, so the length of segment $CM$ is equal to the length of its image $AM'$. Thus, $AM' = CM = 6$.

Now, consider $\triangle M'DM$. Since $DM' = DM = 4$ and $\angle M'DM = 90^\circ$, it is an isosceles right triangle.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find the length of the hypotenuse $M'M$:
$$ (M'M)^2 = (DM')^2 + DM^2 = 4^2 + 4^2 = 16 + 16 = 32 $$
So, $M'M = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
In an isosceles right triangle, the base angles are $45^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle M'MD = 45^\circ$.

Next, consider $\triangle AMM'$. We know the lengths of its three sides: $AM = 2$, $M'M = 4\sqrt{2}$, and $AM' = 6$.
We check if the Pythagorean theorem holds to determine if it is a right triangle:
$$ (AM)^2 + (M'M)^2 = 2^2 + (4\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 32 = 36 $$
$$ (AM')^2 = 6^2 = 36 $$
Since $(AM)^2 + (M'M)^2 = (AM')^2$, by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, $\triangle AMM'$ is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex $M$. Therefore, $\angle AMM' = 90^\circ$.

Finally, the angle we seek, $\angle AMD$, is the sum of the two adjacent angles we have found:
$$ \angle AMD = \angle AMM' + \angle M'MD = 90^\circ + 45^\circ = 135^\circ $$
