The following picture shows the connections between some cities. An investor wishes to build more roads, such that for every pair of cities a road would exist between them, not passing through any other city. The initiative costs 450 000\$, but if some of the roads intersect, it becomes cheaper: there is a 10 000\$ discount for every intersection. The company responsible for building the roads of course wishes to maximize the cost – so it wants the number of intersections to be the smallest possible. What is the biggest possible price for this initiative? We also count the intersections with the roads that already exist.
