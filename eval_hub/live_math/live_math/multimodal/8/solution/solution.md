Let the 2-dimensional CW complex be denoted by $X$. The diagram shows the cell structure of $X$. By identifying all the edges of the same color (and orientation), we find that all vertices are identified to a single point. Thus, there is one 0-cell. There are three distinct colors of edges (red, blue, yellow), so there are three 1-cells, which we can label $r, b, y$ respectively. The 1-skeleton $X^1$ is a wedge of three circles, $S^1_r \vee S^1_b \vee S^1_y$. The fundamental group of the 1-skeleton is the free group on three generators, $\pi_1(X^1) = \langle r, b, y \rangle$.

The shaded region in the diagram is divided into smaller polygons by the internal edges. This gives rise to multiple 2-cells. Reading the relations from the boundaries of these 2-cells (which is a non-trivial exercise in interpreting the diagram) yields a presentation for the fundamental group of $X$. The provided solution text implies the following presentation:
$$ \pi_1(X) \cong \langle r, b, y \mid by^{-1}r^{-1}=1, r^2b=1, yr^{-2}=1 \rangle $$
We can solve for the group using these relations.

From the third relation, $yr^{-2}=1$, we can express $y$ in terms of $r$:
$$ y = r^2 $$

Next, substitute this expression for $y$ into the first relation, $by^{-1}r^{-1}=1$:
$$ b(r^2)^{-1}r^{-1} = 1 $$
$$ b r^{-2} r^{-1} = 1 $$
$$ b r^{-3} = 1 $$
$$ b = r^3 $$

Now we have expressed both $y$ and $b$ as powers of $r$. We can substitute the expression for $b$ into the second relation, $r^2b=1$, to find the relation that $r$ must satisfy:
$$ r^2(r^3) = 1 $$
$$ r^5 = 1 $$

Since both generators $b$ and $y$ can be expressed in terms of $r$, the group is generated by $r$ alone, with the single defining relation $r^5=1$. Therefore, the fundamental group is:
$$ \pi_1(X) \cong \langle r \mid r^5=1 \rangle $$
This is the cyclic group of order 5, commonly denoted as $\mathbb{Z}_5$.

The order of a group is the number of its elements. The order of $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is 5.
