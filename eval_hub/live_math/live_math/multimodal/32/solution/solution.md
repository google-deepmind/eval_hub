First, we determine the parameters of the circular helix from the provided diagram. The radius of the helix is the maximum extent on the x or y axis, which is $r = 2$. The pitch, which is the vertical distance for one complete turn of the helix, is given as $p = 2\sqrt{5}\pi$.

The problem implies a formula for the curvature $K$ of a helix, which is given in the solution text as:
$$ K = \frac{r}{r^2 + (p/2\pi)^2} $$
Substituting the values of $r$ and $p$:
$$ K = \frac{2}{2^2 + (2\sqrt{5}\pi / (2\pi))^2} = \frac{2}{4 + (\sqrt{5})^2} = \frac{2}{4+5} = \frac{2}{9} $$

Next, we use the given relationship between the curvature $K$, radius $r$, the vertical height of the hair $D$, and the actual length of the hair strand $L$:
$$ Kr = 1 - \frac{D^2}{L^2} $$
We are given that the desired height is $D = 20$ cm. We can now substitute the values of $K$, $r$, and $D$ to solve for $L$.
$$ \left(\frac{2}{9}\right) \cdot 2 = 1 - \frac{20^2}{L^2} $$
$$ \frac{4}{9} = 1 - \frac{400}{L^2} $$
Now, we solve for $L^2$:
$$ \frac{400}{L^2} = 1 - \frac{4}{9} $$
$$ \frac{400}{L^2} = \frac{5}{9} $$
$$ L^2 = \frac{400 \times 9}{5} = 80 \times 9 = 720 $$
The length $L$ must be positive, so we take the positive square root:
$$ L = \sqrt{720} = \sqrt{144 \times 5} = 12\sqrt{5} \text{ cm} $$
This is the required length of the hair strand to achieve a vertical height of 20 cm.

The problem states that the hair grows at a rate of 3 cm per month. To find the number of months required to grow to length $L$, we divide the length by the growth rate:
$$ \text{Time (months)} = \frac{L}{3} = \frac{12\sqrt{5}}{3} = 4\sqrt{5} $$
To find the numerical value, we can approximate $\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236$:
$$ \text{Time} = 4\sqrt{5} \approx 4 \times 2.236 = 8.944 \text{ months} $$
The question asks for the minimum whole number of months. Since the hair is not long enough after 8 months, Angie must wait for the 9th month to be completed. Therefore, the minimum number of months required is 9.
