Angie is tired of her hair, so she plans on shaving it all off. However before doing so, she notices a few things. First, her hair length increases by 3 cm each month. Also, she has curly hair, and each strand follows the shape of a circular helix. With the help of her friend, she manages to measure a few things about her hair before shaving them off, as depicted in the following figure. Now, she wants to know: at a minimum, how many months will it take for her hair to grow back to a height of 20 cm after shaving it all off? Note that we want a whole number.
