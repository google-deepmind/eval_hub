Let $c$ be any curve starting at the point $S$ and ending at the point $F$, as shown in the diagram. Denote by $d_A, d_B, d_C$ the maximum distance to any point on the curve $c$ from points $A, B$, and $C$ respectively. Let $d = \max(d_A, d_B, d_C)$. What is the minimum possible value of $d$ over all curves $c$ starting in $S$ and ending in $F$? Round the answer to the nearest integer.
