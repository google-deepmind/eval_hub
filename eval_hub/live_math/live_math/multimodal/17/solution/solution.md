Let the four initial curves be denoted by their self-intersection numbers: -2, -3, -4, and -2. The initial sum of these self-intersection numbers is:
$$ S_{initial} = (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-2) = -11 $$
The problem asks to perform blow-ups at the three red points indicated in the first diagram. Two of these points are at the intersections of curves, and the third is a generic point on the surface, not lying on any of the curves.

Each blow-up introduces a new curve, called an exceptional divisor, which has a self-intersection number of -1. Since there are three blow-ups, three new curves are created, contributing a total of $3 \times (-1) = -3$ to the sum.

The blow-ups also alter the self-intersection numbers of the original curves that pass through the blow-up points. The first diagram shows a blow-up at the intersection of the -2 and -3 curves, and another at the intersection of the -4 and -2 curves.

The final configuration of all curves after the blow-ups is shown in the second diagram. This new configuration consists of 7 curves in total (the 4 original curves, now called proper transforms, and the 3 new exceptional curves).

The self-intersection numbers for these seven curves are given in the second diagram as {-1, -1, -1, -3, -3, -4, -4}.

To find the sum of all self-intersection numbers after the blow-ups are completed, we sum these values:
$$ S_{final} = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-3) + (-3) + (-4) + (-4) $$
$$ S_{final} = -17 $$
Therefore, the sum of all self-intersection numbers of the curves after the blow-ups is -17.
