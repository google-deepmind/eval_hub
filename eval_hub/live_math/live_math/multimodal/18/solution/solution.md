The table has 15 cells. Firstly we need to choose $20 \choose 15$ numbers that we will put into the table. For the number of combinations that we can fill the table consisting of $n$ cells with $n$ numbers, we use the Hook length formula. $\frac{n!}{\prod h(c)}$, where the product is over all cells $c$ of the table and for a cell $c$ the value $h(c)$ is the number of cells in the same row to the right of $c$ plus the number of cells in the same column below $c$ plus one. Together we get ${20 \choose 15} \cdot \frac{15!}{9\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 2\cdot 6\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 4\cdot 2}$.
