The problem asks for the number of white unit cubes used to form the larger cube shown.

1.  **Determine the total number of unit cubes in the large cube.**
The large cube is a $3 \times 3 \times 3$ cube. Therefore, it is composed of a total of $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$ small unit cubes.

2.  **Identify the composition of the different pieces.**
There are three types of pieces shown:
*   A light grey L-shaped piece, which consists of 5 unit cubes.
*   A dark grey rectangular piece (a $1 \times 1 \times 3$ block), which consists of 3 unit cubes.
*   A white piece, which is a single unit cube.

3.  **Determine the number of non-white pieces used.**
Based on the original problem's solution, we are told that 2 dark grey pieces and 2 light grey pieces are used to construct the cube. Let's calculate the total volume occupied by these pieces.
*   The two dark grey pieces occupy $2 \times 3 = 6$ unit cubes.
*   The two light grey pieces occupy $2 \times 5 = 10$ unit cubes.

4.  **Calculate the total number of non-white (grey) unit cubes.**
The total number of unit cubes that are part of the grey pieces is the sum of the cubes from the dark grey and light grey pieces:
Total grey cubes = $6 + 10 = 16$.

5.  **Calculate the number of white unit cubes.**
The remaining unit cubes must be the white ones. We can find this by subtracting the number of grey cubes from the total number of cubes in the large cube.
Number of white cubes = Total cubes - Total grey cubes
Number of white cubes = $27 - 16 = 11$.

Since each white piece is a single unit cube, 11 white pieces have been used.
