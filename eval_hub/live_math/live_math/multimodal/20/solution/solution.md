The homology group $H_{1}(X)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ generated by the two (clock-wise oriented) boundary-components on the inside of the larger disk. With this choice of basis one can trace $\gamma$ with a finger to see that $g=(10,-4)$ and hence that $7 g=(70,-28)$.

Given any homomorphism $\varphi: H_{1}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ there exist integers $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\varphi:(m, n) \mapsto a \cdot m+b \cdot n$. It follows that the answer to the question must be $\operatorname{gcd}(70,-28)=14$.
