Donald has noted in black a Hodge diamond of some smooth Calabi-Yau 4-fold $X$, with holonomy $SU(4)$. An imp came later and replace most of the numbers with purple stains, as in the picture. However, Donald realised that he can still recover the Hodge diamond. Help him, and calculate
$$
\sum_{p=0}^4\sum_{q=0}^4 (p+q)\cdot \left(h^{p,q}(X)\right)^2.
$$
