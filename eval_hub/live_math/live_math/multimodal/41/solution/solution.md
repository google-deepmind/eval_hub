The problem asks for the diameter of the large, light grey semicircle, which encloses all the other semicircles. The diagram shows that the diameters of all semicircles lie on the same straight line, which is the diameter of the largest (light grey) semicircle.

The structure can be analyzed in two parts:

1.  First, let's determine the diameter of the dark grey semicircle. The diagram shows that the dark grey semicircle encloses the yellow and red semicircles, which are placed adjacent to each other along its diameter. Therefore, the diameter of the dark grey semicircle is the sum of the diameters of the yellow and red semicircles.

    Given:
    *   Diameter of the yellow semicircle, $d_{yellow} = 4$.
    *   Diameter of the red semicircle, $d_{red} = 6$.

    The diameter of the dark grey semicircle is:
    $$d_{\text{dark grey}} = d_{yellow} + d_{red} = 4 + 6 = 10$$

2.  Next, let's determine the diameter of the largest, light grey semicircle. Its diameter is composed of two adjacent segments: the diameter of the dark grey semicircle and the diameter of the blue semicircle.

    Given:
    *   Diameter of the blue semicircle, $d_{blue} = 15$.
    *   From the previous step, the diameter of the dark grey semicircle is $d_{\text{dark grey}} = 10$.

    The diameter of the light grey semicircle is the sum of these two diameters:
    $$d_{\text{light grey}} = d_{\text{dark grey}} + d_{blue} = 10 + 15 = 25$$

Thus, the diameter of the light grey semicircle is 25.
