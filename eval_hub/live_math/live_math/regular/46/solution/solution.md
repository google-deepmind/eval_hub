Let us denote by $S_1$ the center of the circle that contains points $A$ and $D$, by $S_2$ the center of the circle that contains points $A$, $B$, by $S_3$ the center of the circle that contains points $B$, $C$ and by $S_4$ the center of the circle that conttains points $C$ and $D$. Of course, points $S_1S_2S_3S_4$ form a quadrilateral containing points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ on its sides. Notice that triangles $S_1DA$,$DS_4C$, $CS_3B$, $BS_2A$ are isosceles, let's denote the angles by their bases by $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$ respectively. Then the sum of the angles with vertices in $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, $S_4$ is $4\cdot 180^{\circ} - 2(\alpha+\beta+\gamma + \delta) = 360^{\circ}$. So we have $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta = 180^{\circ}$. So in quadrilateral $ABCD$ the sum of angles with vertices in $D$ and $B$ is $180^{\circ}$. Then if $|\angle ADC| = 47^{\circ}$, then $|\angle ABC| = 180^{\circ} - 47^{\circ} = 133^{\circ}$.
