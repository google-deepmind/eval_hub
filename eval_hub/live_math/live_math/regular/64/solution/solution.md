There can be at most 1 index i, such that the sequence decreases. Otherwise, it would not reach 3 in the end. If there is exactly one decrease, in all other positions the sequence needs to increase. Therefore, we have 5 possibilities to choose where to decrease. On the other hand, if there are no decreases, we need exactly 3 increases and at two indices we stay the same. Here we have ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ possibilities to choose increases. In total, we get $5 + 10 = 15$.
