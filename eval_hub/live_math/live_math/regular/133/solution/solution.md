From the description of the problem we see that the amount of money on the $k$-th day can be expressed as $a_k = n + 5 + 6 + \ldots k+4 - 10k = n + \frac{k+9}{2}\cdot k - 10k = n + \frac{1}{2}k^2 - 5.5k$. It is enough to notice that the minimum of the quadratic function $\frac{1}{2}k^2 - 5.5k$ is attained in $k=5.5$ and is equal -15.125. Therefore the smallest $n$ satistying the given property is $n=16$.
