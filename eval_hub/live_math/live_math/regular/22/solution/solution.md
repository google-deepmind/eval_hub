Since $AB$ is parallel to $OB$ it is clear that $Area(ABP)=Area(ABO)$. If $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$ and consider the height of triangle $AMO$, it is clear that $AO=1, OM=h$ and by Pytaghorean Theorem we have $AM=\sqrt{1-h^2}$ so the area of $ABO$ is given by $2 \cdot 1/2 \cdot h \cdot \sqrt{1-h^2}$ where $0 \leq h < 1$. To study the maximum of function $h \sqrt{1-h^2}$ we can consider its square given by $h^2(1-h^2)=h^2-h^4$ whose derivative is $2h-4h^3$ which equals to $0$ if and only if $h=0$ or $h=\sqrt{2}/2$ so maximum is attained if $h=\sqrt{2}/2$ and $AB=2h=\sqrt{2}$ so the solution is $2$.
