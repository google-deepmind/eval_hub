As $AC$ and $BD$ are diameters in the circle, we have $\angle AXC = \angle BXD = 90^\circ$. By Pythagorean theorem we then have
 
$$XA^2+XC^2 = AC^2 = BD^2 = XB^2+XD^2.$$
Also from Pythagorean theorem we have
$$AC^2 = BD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 10^2+13^2 = 269.$$
Therefore
$$XB^2+XC^2+XD^2 = 2\cdot 269 - 8^2 = 474.$$
