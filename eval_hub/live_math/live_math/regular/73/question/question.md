Polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with real coefficients both have degree $100$ and both have $100$ real roots. The sum of roots of $P(x)$ is $32$, and the sum of roots of $Q(x)$ is 64. Moreover, the polynomial $P(x) - Q(x)$ is of degree $99$. We know that the polynomial
 $$R(x) = P(x)\cdot (Q(x))^2 + (P(x))^2 \cdot Q(x)$$
has 300 roots. Determine their sum.
