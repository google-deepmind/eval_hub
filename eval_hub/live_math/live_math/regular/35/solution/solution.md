Notice that the equation can be written as $n(n+1)/2-m(m+1)/2=2025$ where $n > m$. Hence $n^2+n-m^2-m=2 \cdot 2025$ so: 
$$(n-m)(n+m+1)=2 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^2.$$
\noindent At left we have two factors and $n-m < n+m+1$. Then we need to solve the system:
$$n-m=x$$
$$n+m+1=y$$
\noindent such that $x \cdot y=4050$. Hence $n=(y+x-1)/2$ and $m=(y-x-1)/2$. Hence $x$ and $y$ must have different parity but since in the decomposition appears only one $2$, this condition is clearly satified. In addition, $y-x-1 > 0$ so $y > x+1$. Notice that $4050$ has $30$ divisors, so there are $15$ ways to express the number as the product of two divisors $x$ and $y$ with $y > x+1$. Hence $x$ could be $1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,25,27,30,45,50,54$. The following one would be $75$ (but $54 \cdot 75=4050$ so it is not considered).
