Consider that the board has $4$ rows and $n$ columns and $n \geq 3$. Then there are exactly:
\begin{itemize}
\item $n$ vertical $4-$lines.
\item $n-3$ horizontal $4-$lines in each row, so there are $4 \cdot (n-3)=4n-12$.
\item There are $n-3$ diagonal $4-$lines from top left to bottom right and $n-3$ diagonal $4-$lines from top right to bottom left so there are $2 \cdot(n-3)=2n-6$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent So there are $n+4n-12+2n-6=7n-18$ $4-$lines. If $7n-18=2348$ then $n=338$.
