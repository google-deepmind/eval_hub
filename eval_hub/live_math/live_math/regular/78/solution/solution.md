It has to be divisible by 4. It has to be less than 20. For contradiction, suppose it was 20. Fact that it can not be more than 20 follows by monotonicity in the following argument. It is the fourth smallest pile from the initial arrangement, because if we distribute the balls from the largest bucket, then it becomes the bucket with the smallest number of balls. Initially, the fourth pile could have at most 9 balls. Therefore we had to add at least 11 balls to it. Also, we were simultaneously adding to the initially smallest pile, so in the fourth round the smallest pile has at least 12 balls. In the third round, the biggest pile has to have at least 17 balls. Therefore at least 9 balls are not in the initial two smallest piles. By a similar argument, we reason about the second and first rounds and we arrive at a contradiction, that in the fourth round total number of balls in all piles is more than 46. The lower bound of 16 can be established by similar arguments supposing in the fourth round the biggest pile contained 12 balls. Remark that 16 can be obtained from initial arrangements 2, 4, 9, 14, 17 on the piles.
