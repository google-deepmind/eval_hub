There are 46 balls in 5 buckets. In each bucket, there is a different number of balls. Then we proceed in turns. Let $k$ be the number of buckets in the current turn. In each turn, we take and distribute balls from the bucket with the largest number of balls currently in it. We take the maximum number of balls from this bucket, such that the number of the balls we take is divisible by $k-1$ and distribute them into the remaining $k-1$ buckets. If at any time there are no balls is some bucket, we remove this bucket and continue without it. We know that the first time some bucket reached 0 balls was in the fourth round. How many balls were in that bucket before it reached 0?
