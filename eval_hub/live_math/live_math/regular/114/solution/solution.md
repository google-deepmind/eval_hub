Let us denote $|BC| = a$, $|CA| = b$, $|AD| = y$, $|DB| = x$, $|CD| = h$. Then, from the similarity of the triangles $CDB$ and $ADC$, it holds that $\frac{57.6}{43.2} = \frac{h}{x} = \frac{y}{h} = \frac{b}{a}$, and moreover $ab = (x+y)h$. From these equations we easily obtain $x = \frac{3}{4}h$, $a = \frac{5}{4}h$. So we have $a + h + x = 43.2$, and substituting what he have just obtained, we get $\frac{5}{4}h + h + \frac{3}{4}h = 43.2$, thus $h = 14.4$. Now, it holds that $a + h + x = 43.2$ and $h+y+b = 57.6$. Adding these 2 equations with $h =  14.4$, we obtain $a + b + x + y= 72$.
