Let $C$ be the circumference of the plate, $v_L$ the ladybug’s speed, and $v_B$ the beetle’s speed. Since the ladybug walks the full circle in the time the beetle walks 60 cm, we have $\frac{C}{v_L} = \frac{60}{v_B} \Rightarrow v_L = \frac{C}{60} v_B$. When moving toward each other on the shorter arc (20 cm), they meet after 30 s: $v_L + v_B = \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}$. On the longer arc ($C - 20$ cm), they meet after 90 s: $v_L + v_B = \frac{C - 20}{90}$. So we get: $\frac{2}{3} = \frac{C - 20}{90} \Rightarrow C = 80$. Thus, the circumference is 80cm.
