A ladybug and a beetle are moving on the edge of a round plate in two opposite directions, starting from two different points $A$ and $B$. We know that the ladybug can go through the whole circle in the same time, during which the beetle would go through an arch of length 60 cm. The length of the shorter arch between $A$ and $B$ is 20 cm. If the ladybug and the beetle were moving on the shorter arc, they would meet after 30 seconds. If they were moving on the longer arc, they would meet after 90 seconds. Calculate the circumference of the plate.
