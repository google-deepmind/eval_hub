Notice that the expression is equivalent to:
$$1+\frac{3b+2a+6}{ab}=1+\frac{7}{ab}=1+\frac{42}{2a \cdot 3b} \geq 1+\frac{168}{(2a+3b)^2}=1+\frac{168}{1}=169$$
\noindent where we have used the AM-GM inequality. For $2a=3b$, that is, $a=1/4$ and $b=1/6$ we have the equality. Hence the lowest value is given by $169$.
