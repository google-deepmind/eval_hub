From the statement we want to minimize the number of $a_i$, that are equal to $+1$ or $-1$. In other words, we want to use the least number of primes to get the result. Since 2023 is not a prime number, the answer is at least 2. Also, any sum or difference of two odd numbers is even, so the answer is at least 3. We can get the answer 3 by the following expression: $2023 = 3 - 7 + 2027$.
