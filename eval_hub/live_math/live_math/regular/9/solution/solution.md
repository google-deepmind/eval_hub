Consider $0 < a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4 < a_5 < a_6$ and $a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6=1002$. We want the sum $a_3+a_6$ to be minimum and it is clear that:
\begin{eqnarray*}
1002=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6 \\ \leq (a_3-2)+(a_3-1)+a_3 + (a_6-2)+(a_6-1)+a_6 = 3(a_3+a_6)-6
\end{eqnarray*}


\noindent so $a_3+a_6 \geq 1008/3=336$ and it is easy to find a distribution satisfying that condition (there are a lot). For instance: $1,2,3,331,332,333$. Hence, the minimum sum is given by $336$.
