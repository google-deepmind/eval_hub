To form a right triangle inscribed in a circle, one of its sides must be a diameter of the circle. A regular 2024-gon has 2024 vertices evenly spaced on a circle, which gives $\frac{2024}{2} = 1012$ distinct diameters (each defined by a pair of opposite vertices). For each such diameter, the third vertex can be any of the remaining $2024 - 2 = 2022$ vertices to form a right triangle. Therefore, the total number of unordered triples of vertices forming right triangles is $1012 \times 2022 = 2046264$.
