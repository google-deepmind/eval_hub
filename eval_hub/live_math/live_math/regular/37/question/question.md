Eight points equally spaced in a circumference are labelled with numbers from $1$ to $8$ ordered from smallest to largest. A token is located at number $1$ and jumps clockwise one by one until it arrives at number $8$. Then, it jumps two by two until it arrives at $8$. Now it jumps three by three until it falls back to number $8$ (notice that it needs to go around the circumference three times to fall right into number $8$). Every time the token falls right into number $8$, the jumps are increasead by one unit. If the token has traveled $70$ laps around the circumference,  what was the length of the last jump?
