We can view it as the difference between two consecutive elements. If we look at the first half of the sequence, then the sum of differences (if we count also the first element) is exactly 7. Therefore we need to distribute 7 among 5 increasing steps. Using stars and bars we get $11 \choose 4$ possibilities. Also, there is the second half, which is independent of the first half. The final answer is $11 \choose 4$$^2$.
