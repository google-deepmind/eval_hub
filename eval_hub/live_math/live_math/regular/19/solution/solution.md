As the hexagon is inscribed in a circle, we have 
 $$\angle FAB + \angle BCD + \angle DEF = 360^\circ.$$
 Hence
 $$\angle DEF = 360^\circ - 120^\circ - 80^\circ = 160^\circ.$$
 Analogously
 $$\angle EFA = 360^\circ - 90^\circ - 100^\circ = 170^\circ.$$
 Hence the product is $160\cdot 170 = 27200$.
 
 Note: one can construct such a hexagon by starting from the circle and taking the arcs $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EF$, $FA$ to have angular lengths $110^\circ$, $70^\circ$, $130^\circ$, $30^\circ$, $10^\circ$, $10^\circ$, respectively.
