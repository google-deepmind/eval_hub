Let $a$ be the number of 5 years old kids, $b$ be the number of 4 years old kids and $c$ be the number of 3 years old kids. Then we have the following system of equations.
   \begin{align*}
   \begin{cases}
       a + b + c = 29\\
       3a + 4b + 5c = 122.
   \end{cases}
   \end{align*}
   Thus it follows that $a= 29-b-c$ and $87-3b-3c+4b+5c = 122$, equivalently $b+2c = 35$. On the other hand, $c=29-a-b$ and $3a +4b + 145 -5a-5b=122$, equivalently $23 = 2a +b$. So we have 
   \begin{align*}
   \begin{cases}
       b+2c = 35\\
       b + 2a = 23,
   \end{cases}
   \end{align*}
   thus $c-a = 6$.\\
