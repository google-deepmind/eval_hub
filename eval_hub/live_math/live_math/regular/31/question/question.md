A straight road connects towns $A$ and $B$ and the town $M$ is exactly in the middle of the road. Car $1$ travels with the constant speed $120\, \text{km}/\text{h}$ from the town $A$ to the town $B$. Car $2$ travels with a constant speed from the town $B$ to the town $M$, then increases its speed twice and travels with that new, constant speed to the town $A$. The cars $1$ and $2$ start at the same time and pass each other in a point which is $4$ times closer to the town $B$ than to the town $A$. What was the average speed of the car $2$ on the road from $B$ to $A$, in kilometers per hour?
