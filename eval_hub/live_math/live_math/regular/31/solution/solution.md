When the cars met, the car $2$ was going with its initial speed. As it traveled $4$ times less distance than the car $1$, its speed must had been $4$ times lower, so equal to $30\, \text{km}/\text{h}$. Then starting from the town $M$, it was traveling with $60\, \text{km}/\text{h}$. If the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $120x\, \text{km}$, then the car $2$ has travelled for $2x$ hours between $B$ and $M$, and then $x$ hours between $M$ and $A$. That means that it travelled $120x\, \text{km}$ in $3\, \text{h}$. Hence its average speed was $40\, \text{km}/\text{h}$.
