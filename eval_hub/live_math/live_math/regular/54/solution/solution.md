We are given that $|A_1 - A_3| < A_4 - A_2$ and $A_1 + A_3 = A_2 + A_4$. From the second condition, we can rearrange it as $A_1 - A_2 = A_4 - A_3$. Now consider the inequality:
$|A_1 - A_3| < A_4 - A_2$. Using the identity $A_1 - A_2 = A_4 - A_3$, we can write: $A_1 - A_3 = (A_4 - A_3) - (A_2 - A_3)$.From the second condition: $A_1 - A_2 = A_4 - A_3$, so $A_1 - A_3 = A_4 - A_2$. But this contradicts the inequality $|A_1 - A_3| < A_4 - A_2$, unless $A_1 - A_3$ is negative. So the only way $|A_1 - A_3| < A_4 - A_2$ and $A_1 + A_3 = A_2 + A_4$ both hold is if $A_1 - A_3$ is negative, and $A_4 - A_2$ is positive and larger in magnitude. This implies: $A_3 > A_1$ and $A_4 > A_2$, and since $A_3$ and $A_4$ are both greater than their symmetric counterparts, and their sum equals $A_1 + A_3 = A_2 + A_4$, the only possibility is that $A_4$ is the largest among the four. Therefore, the index of the largest number is $4$.
