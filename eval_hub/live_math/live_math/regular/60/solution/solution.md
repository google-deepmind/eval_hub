Let $k$ be the amount collected by each of the schools. Then the first school must have $k$ students, the second must have $\frac k3$, the third $\frac k5$, the fourth $\frac k7$, the fifth $\frac k9$. We get from that that $k$ is divisible by $5\cdot7\cdot 9 = 315$. Let $k=315a$. Then in the five schools we have respectively $315a$, $105a$, $63a$, $45a$, $35a$ students. This gives in total $563a$ students. There is only one number divisible by $563$ between $8000$ and $9000$, and that is $8445$.
