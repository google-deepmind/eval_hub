First, we factor the expression: $2^{24} - 2^{20} = 2^{20} \cdot 3 \cdot 5$. We want to find all 3-digit numbers that divide this product. Any such divisor must be of the form $2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c$, where $0 \leq a \leq 20$, $0 \leq b \leq 1$, and $0 \leq c \leq 1$. We test all such combinations, for example by writing a short code, and count how many values lie between 100 and 999. After checking all valid combinations, we find that there are exactly 13 such numbers.
