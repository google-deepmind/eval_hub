We have
$$37 - 21 = 16.$$
Subtracting this from 21 gives
$$2\cdot 21 - 37 = 5.$$
Then subtracting this equation three times from the previous one, we get
$$ 4\cdot 37 - 7\cdot 21 = 1.$$
Hence the frog is able to get to the neighbouring stone in $11$ jumps, $4$ by $37$ stones to the right and $7$ by $21$ stones to the left. This is the minimal possible number of jumps. Otherwise, we would get $37a + 27b = 1$ for some integers $a,b$ such that $|a|+|b|\le 11$. But this means that $27b \equiv 1\pmod {37}$. If $b<0$, then $|b|\ge 7$ and consequently $|a|\ge 4$. If $b>0$, then $b\ge 14$. Hence in any case, $|a| + |b| \ge 11$. Hence, the minimal number of jumps needed is 11.
