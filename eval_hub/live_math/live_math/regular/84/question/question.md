In the Babel garden, there is a row of stones extending infinitely in both directions. A frog is sitting on one of the stones. It wants to move to the neighbouring stone, but in one jump it can only jump by $21$ or $37$ stones to the right or to the left. That is, there is always exactly 20 or 36 stones between the stone from which the frog jumps and the stone to which it jumps. How many jumps, at least, does the frog need to move to stone neighbouring the initial one?
