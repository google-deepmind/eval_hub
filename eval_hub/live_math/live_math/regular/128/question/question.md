In the acute-angled triangle $ABC$, we choose point $D$ on the segment $BC$. The perpendicular bisector of segment $AD$ intersects the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ at points $E$ and $F$, where points $E$ and $F$ are in the arcs $AB$ and $AC$ respectively. Let $U$ be the point where line $AD$ intersects the circumcircle for the second time, and let $G$ be the point where line $FD$ intersects segment $EU$. Find the measure of angle $EGD$.
