Since $EF$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AD$, we know that $AFD$ is an isosceles triangle. Let $|\angle FAD| = |\angle ADF| = \alpha$. Then also $|\angle FEU| = \alpha$,  because it lies on the same arc as $\angle FAU =\angle FAD$. Let us denote by $M$ the midpoint of $AD$. Then $|\angle EMU| = 90^{\circ}$, so $|\angle EUD| = 90^{\circ}-\alpha$. Angles $GDU$ and $ADF$ are vertical, thus $|\angle GDU| = \alpha$. Now, using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^{\circ}$, we obtain $|\angle DGU| = 90^{\circ}$, and $\angle EGD=180-\angle DGU=90^{\circ}$.\\
