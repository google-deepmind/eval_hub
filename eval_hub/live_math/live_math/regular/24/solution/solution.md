Notice that any number which ends in $5$ or $0$ is clearly eliminated. Now we have $100$ numbers which ends in $1$, $100$ numbers which ends in $2$, etc. It is easy that $a^{100} \equiv 1 (mod. 10)$ or $a^{100} \equiv 6 (mod. 10)$ for any digit $a \neq 0,5$. Hence, the product of the numbers finish in $6$. It is enough to remove a number which finish in $3$ and we are done. The lowest amount of deleted numbers would be $200+1=201$.
