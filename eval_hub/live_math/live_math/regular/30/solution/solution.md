Firstly observe that the largest circle is always visible. Therefore we can iterate on the possible positions of the largest circle. It can go from the 3rd to the 10th position if we want to have a chance to satisfy the requirements. If the largest circle goes to the (x+1)th position, then we need to choose which smaller circles go in front of the largest one. There are $9 \choose x$ possibilities. Then we just need to express in how many ways we can arrange $x$ circles in such a way that there are exactly 2 of them visible. For this, we can use similar reasoning. The remaining circles behind the largest one can be arranged arbitrarily in any permutation because none of them will be visible. The final expression is \newline $\sum_{x=2}^{9}$  $9 \choose x$ $\cdot (9 - x)! \cdot$  $\sum_{k=1}^{x-1}$ $x-1 \choose k$ $\cdot (k-1)!\cdot (x-k-1)!$. The expression can be simplified to $\sum_{x=2}^{9} \frac{9!}{x}\cdot(\sum_{k=1}^{x-1}1/k) = 1172700$.
