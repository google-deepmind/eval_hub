If the number $x$ is even, then there are exactly half of the numbers less than $x$ with an odd number of "ones". Because the last bit of the number is switched between consecutive pair of even-odd numbers and this swaps the parity on ones in the numbers. Therefore we need to multiply 2018 by 2, and then take first number less than 4036, that has even number of "ones" in its binary representation.
