There are 4 states. Either we have both the dice and the coin or we have only dice, or we have only coin or none of them. The game ends when we have none of them, therefore we need to calculate the number of steps to reach the final state from the initial state. To calculate this assign probabilities to transition between states and express the expectation. After calculations, the result is $\frac{44}{7}$.
