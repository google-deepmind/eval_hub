We have one dice and one coin. In one round we throw both at the same time. If the coin lands on the head, we remove it from the game for every next round. If the dice rolls to 6, we remove it from the game for every next round. Calculate the expected number of rounds until we have no items to play with. Write the answer as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the result simple fraction.
