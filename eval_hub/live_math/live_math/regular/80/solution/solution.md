The letter "A" is the only letter with an odd number of occurrences. Therefore "A" will be in the middle of the word. If we split the rest of the palindrome into two halves and arrange letters in the first half, there will be only one option for the arrangement of the letters in the second half to form a palindrome. It suffices to count the number of arrangements of 2 letters "A", 2 letters "B", 2 letters "C" and 1 letter "D", which is $\frac{7!}{8}$.
