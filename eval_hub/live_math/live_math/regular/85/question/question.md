A triangle $ABC$ is given. Point $D$ lies on the side $AB$ and points $E$, $F$ lie on the side $BC$, with $E$ closer than $F$ to $B$. We have $AD =2a$, $DB = 5a$, $BE = 3b$, $EF = 2b$, $FC = b$ for some positive real numbers $a$, $b$. The lines $AF$ and $AE$ intersect the line $CD$ at the points $G$ and $H$, respectively. The surface area of the quadrilateral $EFGH$ is $315$. Find the surface area of the triangle $ABC$.
