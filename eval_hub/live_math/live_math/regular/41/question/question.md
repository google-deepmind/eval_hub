There are 20 points in the line and are numbered in the order they lie on the line from 1 to 20. An edge can be placed only between two points that are next to each other. Points with numbers 1, 3, and 13 should have 1 edge connecting them with another point, and points 2, 10, and 15 should have either 0 or 2 edges connecting them with another point. In how many ways we can add edges between two adjacent points such that the conditions are satisfied?
