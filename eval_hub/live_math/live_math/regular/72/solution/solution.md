Let $H$ be the height of the lateral face of the pyramid and let $h$ be the height of the pyramid. Let $a$ be the length of the side of the square $ABCD$. Then $|AS| = \frac{3a\sqrt{2}}{2}$. From the Pythagorean theorem we have $H^2 + \frac{a^2}{4} = \frac{9a^2 \cdot 2}{4}$, so $H = \frac{a\sqrt{17}}{2}$. Then, since the area of ACS is $50\sqrt{2}$, we obtain $\frac{1}{2}a\sqrt{2}h = 50\sqrt{2}$, so $ah = 100$. Again from the Pythagorean theorem we have $h^2 + \frac{a^2}{4} = H^2$, so using $H = \frac{a\sqrt{17}}{2}$, we get $h=2a$. Thus $a \cdot 2a = 100$, and therefore $a = 5\sqrt{2}$. So the lateral surface is $4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 5\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{5\sqrt{34}}{2} = 50\sqrt{17}$, and the answer is 67.
