We know that if $n$ has the prime decomposition
$$ n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \dots p_k^{\alpha_k},$$
then the number of divisors of $n$ is $(p_1+1)(p_2+1)\dots(p_k+1)$. Then if the number of proper divisors is $76$, we have
$$(p_1+1)(p_2+1)\dots(p_k+1) = 77.$$
This means that $n = p_1^{76}$ or $n = p_1^6\cdot p_2^{10}$. In the former case $$n \ge 2^{76} > 2^{70} =1024^7 > 10^{21}.$$
In the latter, the minimal value of $n$ we can attain is
$$3^6\cdot 2^{10} =  746496.$$
This is clearly smaller than the previous one.
