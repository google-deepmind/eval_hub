We use the formula for $1^2+2^2+...+n^2=\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. Notice that if Alice drew squares with sides $1, 2, ..., n$, then Bob drew squares with sides $0, 1, ..., n-1$. We are looking at the ratio of $\frac{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}}{\frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6}}=\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{(n-1)(2n-1)}\leq\frac{21}{20}$. Now we need to solve the quadratic inequality and observe that 62 is the first integer greater than 1 for which the inequality holds.
