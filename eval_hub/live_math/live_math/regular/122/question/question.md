Alice drew multiple squares with increasing side lengths 1, 2, 3,...,n. Then Bob came and inside each square, he drew another square with the length of sides exactly one less than the length of sides of the square drawn by Alice. By $A$ denote the total area of squares drawn by Alice and by $B$ denote the total area of squares drawn by Bob. At least how many squares have Alice drawn if the ratio $\frac{A}{B}\leq\frac{21}{20}$?
