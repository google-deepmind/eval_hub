The number $10^{1001}-1$ is not possible to attain. For any natural number $n$, let $S(n)$ denote its sum of digits. If any two numbers $x$ and $y$ have a sum $10^{1001}-1$, then there is no carrying over when they are added. Therefore $S(x+y) = S(x) + S(y)$, so if $x$ and $y$ are the numbers written by Matthew, we have $S(x+y) = 2 S(x)$, and $S(10^{1001}-1) = 9999$, an odd number. However, we can attain the number $10^{1001}-2$. Indeed, let
$$x = \underbrace{44\dots 4}_{500\text{ times}}\underbrace{55\dots 5}_{500\text{ times}}4$$
and
$$y = \underbrace{55\dots 5}_{500\text{ times}}\underbrace{44\dots 4}_{500\text{ times}}4.$$
They satisfy the conditions and their sum is $10^{1001}-2$. The last $19$ digits
is $9999999999999999998$.
