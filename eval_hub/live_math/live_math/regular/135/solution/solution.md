We can consider several cases based on how many of the newly added numbers are below the median of the final sequence. Notice that if we want to make some number below the median since we want to maximize the median, it is optimal to choose its value as 1. And if we decided that $x$ numbers should be above the median, it is optimal to maximize the minimum value of them. Therefore we want to split the remaining part of the sum as equally as possible. Let $k$ be the count of the added numbers below the median. If $k\geq 2$, then the median is at most $6$. If $k=0$, we can split $25/4 = 6.25$, and the smallest of the numbers is 6. In this case, the median is again 6. Finally, if $k=1$, then we add a number 1. Then we split $24/3=8$ and we add three numbers 8. In this case, the median is 8, which is the maximum of all cases and therefore it is the answer.
