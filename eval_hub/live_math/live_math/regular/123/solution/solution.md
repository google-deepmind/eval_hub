Let $F$ lie on the side $CD$ such that $EF$ is parallel to $AD$. Then the triangles $EFD$ and $CFE$ are right. Moreover
 $$\frac{EF}{FD} = \frac{0.4\cdot AB}{0.2\cdot CD} = 2$$
 and
 $$\frac{CF}{EF} = \frac{0.8\cdot AB}{0.4\cdot CD} = 2.$$
 Hence the triangles $EFD$ and $CFE$ are similar, and therefore $\angle CED = 90^\circ$.
