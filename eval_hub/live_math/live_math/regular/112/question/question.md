Anna wants to cut a ribbon into 3 parts. After she did it, she noticed that if the first piece was $\frac{4}{3}$ times longer than it was just after she cut it, and the second piece was of the length equal to $\frac{3}{4}$ of its current length, then the 3 parts would be equal. The length of the third piece equals a certain fraction of the whole length of the ribbon. This fraction can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$,  where $a$ and $b$ are coprime natural numbers. Calculate $a-b$.
