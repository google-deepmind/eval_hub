We draw a segment from the center of the circle on top with the vertex of the triangle above and another segment from the center of the same circle to the left side of the triangle and perpendicular to it.


Then we construct half an equilateral triangle so the first segment is given by the double of the radius of the circle. Hence, if $n$ is the number of circles, we have:
$$(2n+1)\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{217}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 4=2\sqrt{3}$$
so $n=108$.
