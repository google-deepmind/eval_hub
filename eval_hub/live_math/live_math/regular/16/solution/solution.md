We have $BC^2 + CD^2 = 17^2+19^2 = 650 = 23^2+11^2 = DA^2+AB^2$. Hence we can construct a quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfying the conditions with $\angle BCD = \angle DAB = 90^\circ$. Then its area is
 $$\frac{17\cdot 19 + 23\cdot 11}{2} = 288.$$
This is the largest possible area, as $[BCD] \le \frac{BC\cdot CD}{2}$ and $[BAD] \le \frac{BA\cdot AD}{2}$.
