Alice's great-grandmother was born in the last decade of the 19th century, so between the years 1890 and 1899. We are told that she turned $x$ years old in the year $x^2$, and this occurred in the 20th century, so $x^2$ is between 1900 and 1999. We want to find an integer $x$ such that $x^2$ is in the range $[1900, 1999]$. Try successive values:$x = 44 \Rightarrow x^2 = 1936$, $x = 45 \Rightarrow x^2 = 2025$ (too big). So the only integer $x$ for which $x^2$ is a year in the 20th century is $x = 44$.That means she turned 44 in the year 1936, so her birth year was $1936 - 44 = 1892$. Therefore, Alice's great-grandmother was born in the year $1892$.
