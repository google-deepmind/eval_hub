A stained glass window consists of four rows of glass pieces in three columns, one below the other. Julia has already painted eight glass pieces in various colors, choosing the pieces uniformly at random. Now, she would like to paint four glass pieces in silver (a color she hasn't used before) in such a way that no two silver glass pieces are adjacent to each other in one row (they can be adjacent in columns). The probability that she can do this can be expressed by a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m+n$.
