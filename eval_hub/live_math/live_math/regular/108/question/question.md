Anna is trying to pass through a Haunted House. It consists of 5 rooms numbered with natural numbers from 1 to 5. From a given room, she can either move to the room with the next number or go back to the previous room. Sometimes, with probability $0.1$, the room frightens Anna so much that she goes back to the previous room, and with probability $0.9$, she proceeds to the next room. We assume that from the starting point (in front of the House), she enters room number 1 with probability 1 (but it still can happen that she can get scared and come back to the starting point, with probability 0.1). Probability that Anna leaves the Haunted House by the back door in the room number 5 without returning to the starting point, can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Find $b-a$.
