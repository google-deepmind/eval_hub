It is clear that $a=3$ (otherwise, the remainder of dividing by $16$ would be $0$ if $a \geq 3$ or different from $8$ if $a=1$ or $a=2$). Also notice that $c = 1$ and $b \leq 2$ (otherwise we would also get remainder $0$). We have two options  for $b$: $b=1$ or $b=2$ but the second one is not valid since we would get remainder $9$ or $0$ when dividing by $27$. Hence $b=1$ and $a+b+c=3+1+1=5$. We get that $N=120 \cdot 79 = 9480$ works so we are done. $\blacksquare$
