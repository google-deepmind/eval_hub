Notice that the equation is equivalent to $(x+y)(x-y)=a$ so if $a$ can be decomposed as $a=m \cdot n$, $m \neq n$ and $m+n$ is even, we will get four solutions (corresponding to the four possibilities $m \cdot n = n \cdot m = (-m) \cdot (-n) = (-n) \cdot (-m)$. If $m=n$, then we will get only two solutions. Bearing in mind these considerations, the lowest $a$ is given by $15=1 \cdot 15 = 3 \cdot 5$ so we will get $4+4=8$ solutions.
