Let $x,y,z$ be the lengths of the different edges. It is clear that $4(x+y+z)=50$ so $x+y+z=25/2$. Notice that the longest diagonal is given by $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$ so $x^2+y^2+z^2=297/4$. But $x^2+y^2+z^2=(x+y+z)^2-2(xy+yz+xz)$ so:
$$\frac{297}{4}=\frac{625}{4}-2(20+16+xz)$$
\noindent and we have that the area of the last face is given by $xz=5$.
