It can be proven that if in prime factorization of some number n, there are x primes (counted with multiplicities), then the answer is all numbers that are the product of exactly $\frac{x}{2}$ primes from the factorization. In case of odd x we need to check $\lceil{\frac{x}{2}}\rceil$ and $\lfloor{\frac{x}{2}}\rfloor$. Then the answer is 4. The set could be $2 \cdot 2, 2 \cdot 11, 2 \cdot 23, 11 \cdot 23$, which is $4, 22, 46, 253$.
