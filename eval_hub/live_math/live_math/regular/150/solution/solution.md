Let $D$ be the point of tangency of the incircle at the side $AB$. Let $DE$ be a diameter of the incircle. A homothety argument shows that the line $CE$ intersects $AB$ at the tangency point of the excircle. Let us call that point $F$. We know (easy and common computation) that $AD = BF$. Therefore $M$ is the middle of the segment $DE$. As $I$ is the middle of $DE$, we then have that $MI$ is parallel to $EF$. Now we can use Thales's theorem to get
 $$\frac{BK}{BC} = \frac{BM}{BF}.$$
We have $BM = 45/2$ and $BF = (AB+AC-BC)/2 = 20$. Hence $\frac{BM}{BF} = 9/8$. Therefore
$$BK = 9/8\cdot BC = 36.$$
Hence the answer is $36+3 = 39$.
