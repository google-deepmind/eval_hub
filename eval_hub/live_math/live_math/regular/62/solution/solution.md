Iterate from 16 to 1 and count the number of subsets that satisfy the condition from the statement and the selected number is the smallest in the set. For 16 it is 1 and for every other number $x$, sum the values that have all the numbers that are divisible by $x$. Also, add +1 for the subset containing just $x$. To obtain the answer sum all the obtained values for all numbers from 1 to 16.
