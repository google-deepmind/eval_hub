Let the angle have a vertex $A$ and let $o_1$ be tangent to its arms at points $B$ and $C$, and let the centers of $o_1$ and $o_2$ be $O_1$, $O_2$, respectively. Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be their radii. Let $K$ be their tangency point and $L$ the other point of intersection of $AK$ with $o_1$. The triangle $AO_1B$ is a half of the equilateral triangle and hence $AO_1 = 2 BO_1 = 2r$. We then have $AK = AO_1 + O_1K = 2r +r =3r$. As $AL = AO_1-O_1L = 2r-r$, we get that $o_2$ is homothetic to $o_1$, with center $A$ and ratio $3$. Doing the same for the pairs $o_2$ and $o_3$ as well as $o_3$ and $o_4$, we get that the radius of $o_4$ is $3^3 = 27$ times larger than the radius of $o_1$. Hence the area ratio is $27^2 = 729$.
