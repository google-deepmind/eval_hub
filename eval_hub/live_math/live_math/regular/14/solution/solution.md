We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ of four-digit integers such that 
 $$10000x + y = 4567(x+y).$$
 This is equivalent to
 $$1811 x = 1522 y$$
 and the numbers $1811$ and $1522$ are coprime. Hence $x = 1522a$, $y = 1811a$ for some integer $a$. As both $x$ and $y$ have to be $4$-digit numbers, we have $a\in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$. In that case, $n = 3333a$. Hence the sum of all possible $n$'s is
 $$3333\cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 3333 \cdot 15 = 49995.$$
