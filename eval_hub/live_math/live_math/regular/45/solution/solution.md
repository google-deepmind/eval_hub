We denote by $[F]$ the area of a figure $F$. Notice that the altitude from the point $A$ has length $12$ and its foot divides the side $BC$ into segments of length $5$ and $9$. That is because $\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = 13$ and $\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = 15$. Hence the area of the triangle is $14\cdot 12/2 = 84$. Now let $H$ be the orthocentre of the triangle. We know that $D$, $E$, $F$ are symmetric to $H$ with respect to $BC$, $AC$, $AB$, respectively. As the triangle is acute, the point $H$ lies inside the triangle $ABC$. We then have
 $$[AFBDCE] = [ABC] + [BCD] + [ACE] + [ABF] = [ABC] + [BCH] + [ACH] + [ABH] = 2[ABC] = 168.$$
