In a triangle $ABC$ we have $AB = 13$, $BC=14$, $CA=15$. The line through $A$, perpendicular to the side $BC$, intersects the circumcircle of $ABC$ at the point $D$ different from $A$. The line through $B$, perpendicular to the side $CA$, intersects the circumcircle of $ABC$ at the point $E$ different from $B$. The line through $C$, perpendicular to the side $AB$, intersects the circumcircle of $ABC$ at the point $F$ different from $C$. Find the area of the hexagon $AFBDCE$.
