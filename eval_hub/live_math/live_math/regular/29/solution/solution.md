Let $x = a \cdot d$. The largest $d$ we can achieve is $385$. Therefore $x$ is a multiple of $385$. Now we need to find the lowest possible value of $a$. If we divide $d(a + 1)|385d$ by $d$, it follows that $(a + 1)|385$. We are looking for the smallest divisor of $385$ other than $1$. From prime factorization $385 = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$ we see that the lowest divisor is $5$. Then $a = 4$ and $x = 4 \cdot 385$.
