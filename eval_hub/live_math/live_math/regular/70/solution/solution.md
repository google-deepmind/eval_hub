The sum of the digits in 20241 is 9 and the sum of the digits in 54442 is 19, so at least 5 steps were required. If there was no permuting step, we would get number 20746 at the end, and we got 54442 -- so there was at least one permuting step. In total we see that at least 6 steps were needed, and here is the sequence of steps: 20241 -> 20342 -> 20443 -> 20544 -> 54240 -> 54341 -> 54442.
