There is a square grid with integer coordinates of size 10. Point (0,0) is in the bottom-left and point (10,10) is in the top-right. In the beginning you are at the point (0,0) and you can move only up and right. Count the number of ways to reach point (10, 10) if at any point (x,y) you visit, it holds $x\geq y$, and you can visit at most 5 points (including starting and finishing point) where $x \leq y + 1$.
