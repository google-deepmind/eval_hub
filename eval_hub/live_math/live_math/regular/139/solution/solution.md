The situation is symmetric in we look from the initial or from the last point. Therefore in the beginning we have to make two moves to the right, if we want to satisfy the condition $x\leq y + 1$ for at most 5 points. From this follows that we always get at least 4 points satisfying that condition. By $c_n$ denote the Catalan number of size $n$. Now we can split cases on the possible positions of the last point satisfying $x\leq y + 1$. And the path will look like following: from (0,0) to (2,0), then to (a + 2, a) which is the point after which we go up to (a + 2, a + 1) and right to (a + 3, a + 1) and then to (10, 8) and last steps to (10, 10). We can see that there are two segments for which the number of paths can be calculated with Catalan numbers and the rest is fixed. We get $c_7 + c_1c_6 + c_2c_5 + c_3c_4 + c_4c_3 + c_5c_2 + c_6c_1 + c_7$. Also we can not forget to add the case when only 4 points satisfy the condition $x\leq y + 1$. The answer for this case is just $c_8$.
