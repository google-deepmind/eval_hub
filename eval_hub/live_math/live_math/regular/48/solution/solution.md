Note that
 $$\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{15}{6} = \frac{5}{2} = \frac{35}{14} = \frac{AD}{DC}.$$
This means that the circle with diameter $BD$ is an Apollonius circle for the interval $AC$ and ratio $5:2$. The point $E$ lies on that circle, as $\angle BED = 90^\circ$. This means that $\frac{EA}{EC} = \frac{5}{2}$. The answer is then $5+2=7$.
