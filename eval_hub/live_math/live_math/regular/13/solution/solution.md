The answer is $52$. For any sequence of $51$ girls we see that they need to have pairwise distinct colours of hats. Hence the answer is at least $51$. However, if it is equal to $51$, then from this property every girl has to have the same colour of the hat as the one standing $51$ places to the right from her. If we go around this way 254 times, then we arrive at a girl only distant 6 places from the original one. This is a contradiction, as they cannot have the same hat colour. But in similar way, we can produce a $52$-periodic colouring, as $13000$ is divisible by $52$.
