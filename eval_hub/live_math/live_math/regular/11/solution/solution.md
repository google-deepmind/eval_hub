Note that if Martin only writes pluses, then the whole expression has the value $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 100 = \frac{100\cdot 101}{2} = 5050$. Any change of a sign will keep the parity of the whole expression, therefore it is always even. The possible values range from $-5050$ to $5050$. We will show that every even number in that interval can be attained.


First, we attain $-5050$ by writing only minuses. Then if we change the first minus to plus, we get $-5050+2$. If we change that plus back to minus, but change the next one to plus, we get $-5050+4$. This way, by ``moving'' the plus to the right, we add 2 to the expression every time. This way, we get every possible value up to $-5050 + 200$. Next we fix the last plus, and perform the same procedure by writing the plus in front of 1, and then moving it to the right, up to $+99$. Hence we attain all even values up to $-5050 + 200 + 198$. Then by fixing last two pluses, with the same procedure we attain all the values up to $-5050 + 200 + 198 + 196$. Continuing this with more and more pluses, we attain every even value up to $5050$. Hence, overall we have $2525$ possible positive values, $2525$ possible negative values, as well as we can attain $0$. Therefore the total number of possible values is $5051$.
