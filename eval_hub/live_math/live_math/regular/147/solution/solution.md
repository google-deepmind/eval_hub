The sum of all the times is $156$ minutes so the ideal would be that each hairdresser uses $156/2=78$ minutes. Notice that all the times are multiples of $3$ except $37,25$ and $13$ which have remainder $1$ when divided by $3$.  Since $78$ is also multiple of $3$ and we have $37+25+13=75$, this is the closest multiple of $3$ that we can get. Hence we cannot get $78$ and $78$. However, we can get $77$ and $79$ since $77=37+25+15$ and $79=27+18+13+12+9$. Hence, the earliest hour would be $12:19$~AM so $X=19$.
