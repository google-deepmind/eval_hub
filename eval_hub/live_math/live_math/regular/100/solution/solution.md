Draw a parallel to $EF$ through $C$ which intersects $ED$ and $FB$ in $H$ and $G$ respectively. It is clear that $EA=AF$, $DH=FB$ and $BG=ED$. Then $EH=DE+FB$ since $DH=FB$ by symmetry and it is clear that the height from $D$ over $AC$ is given by $EA$. To calculate $EA$, notice that $AFB$ and $DEA$ are congruent triangles so $DE/EA=AF/FB$ and since $EA=AF$ we have $EA=\sqrt{DE \cdot FB}$. The area of $ABCD$ is given by $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{DE \cdot FB} (DE+FB)=\sqrt{DE \cdot FB} (DE+FB)=6 \cdot(12+3)=90$ and we are done.
