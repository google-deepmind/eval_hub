It is optimal to place all leaves as far as possible from the root to minimize d. Notice that d has to be bigger than 4, because if it was at most 4, the root can have only at most 4 neighbours, they can have at most 3 other neighbours each and the same holds for the vertices on layer two. From this it follows that at distance 3 we can have at most $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 36 < 64$ vertices. If we allow maximum degree of 5, we can obtain by similar construction where root has 4 neighbours, they have 4 other neighbours and the neighbours of neighbours of the root have also 4 new neighbours each. By this we get exactly $4\cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$ leaf vertices at distance at most 3 as needed.
