Let the arithmetic progression be $(x,x+15,x+30,x+45)$. We have
 $$x(x+15)(x+30)(x+45) = (x^2 + 45x)(x^2+45x + 450) = (x^2+45x+225)^2 - 225^2.$$
 Hence Bob can write $(x^2+45+225)^2$ and the difference will be $225^2 = 50625$. Due to $x$ having $10$ digits, there can be no square closer than $225^2$ (as the distances between consecutive squares of this size have at least $19$ digits).
