We will divide all the amounts by 5 (and later multiply the answer by 5). Now we are given coins of values $3$ and $20$. They are coprime. It is a known fact that for coprime positive integers $a$, $b$ we can express any number larger than $ab-a-b$ as a sum of positive multiples of $a$ and $b$; and we cannot express $ab-a-b$ itself this way. Therefore, starting from $3\cdot 20 - 3 - 20 + 1 = 38$, Matthew's sequence contains all the integers. It does not contain the number $37$. Therefore it starts being an arithmetic progression from the number $38$. Multiplying by $5$, we get $190$.
