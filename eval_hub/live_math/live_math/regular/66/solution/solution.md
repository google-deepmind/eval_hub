There are 3 cases. Either the sequence has more "zeros", or more "ones" or the number of "zeros" and "ones" is the same. There is the same number of sequences, which have more "zeros" and more "ones". The number of sequences, that have the same number of "zeros" and "ones" is ${18 \choose 9}$. Total number of sequences is $2^{18}$. To get the answer we need to add the number of sequences that have more "zeros" and the sequences with the same number of "zeros" and "ones": $\frac{2^{18} - {18 \choose 9}}{2} + {18 \choose 9}$.
