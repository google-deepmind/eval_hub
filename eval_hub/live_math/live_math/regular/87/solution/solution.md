If we look at terms containing different powers of $n$ separately, we obtain 3 different sequences, for which we need to sum the first 100 terms. These sequences are $\sum_{x=1}^{100}1$, $\sum_{x=1}^{100}-5x$, $\sum_{x=1}^{100}3x^2$. For the latter two, we can use known formulas for their sum $\sum_{x=1}^{n}x = \frac{x\cdot (x+1)}{2}$, $\sum_{x=1}^{n}x^2 = \frac{n\cdot (n+1)\cdot (2n+1)}{6}$. After substitution of 100 for $n$ and multiplying these sums with corresponding coefficients we obtain the answer.
