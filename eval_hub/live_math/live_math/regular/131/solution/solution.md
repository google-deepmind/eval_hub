The optimal strategy is to go inside the room, and if we are lucky and our chest is not opened yet, then switch to one of the other chests. To calculate probability notice that our initial guess is correct with probability $\frac{1}{10}$. It means that the probability the prize is in one of the other chests is $\frac{9}{10}$. If we enter the room with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, we lose. With probability $\frac{1}{2}$, we continue. Here we know that with probability $\frac{9}{10}$ is prize in one of the 4 chests, that are not opened and we did not select them. With probability $\frac{1}{4}$ we select one of them. Together we get $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{9}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{4}=\frac{9}{80}\geq\frac{1}{10}$.
