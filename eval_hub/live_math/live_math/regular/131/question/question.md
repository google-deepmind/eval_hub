There are 10 chests in the room. One of them contains 100,000 dollars and the others are empty. The host asks you to select one of the chests. Afterwards, you go out of the room. Then the host randomly opens 5 chests. Then you can decide if you want to get the content of the chest you selected or you can go inside the room. If you decide to go into the room and the chest you selected is opened, then you get nothing (even if the chest you selected contains 100,000 dollars). If it is not opened, then you can decide to change your selected chest or you can stay with the chest you selected in the beginning. In the end, you get the content of that chest. What is the maximum probability of getting 100,000 dollars if you perform actions optimally? Multiply the final answer by 10000.
