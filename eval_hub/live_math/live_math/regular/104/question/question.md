Alice has $n+1$ white squares numbered from 0 to $n$ with a side of length $n$. Inside the $i$-th square, she draws a black square with a side of length $i$. Bob has $2n+1$ white squares numbered from 0 to $2n$ with a side of length $2n$. Similarly, inside the $i$-th square, he draws a black square with a side of length $i$. Let $a$ be the ratio between the area of the black squares and the area of all squares Alice had at the beginning. Let $b$ be the analogous value for Bob. Find $n$ if we know that $a-b=\frac{1}{60}$.
