Let $m = 2n$. Then the difference $a-b$ we can express as $\frac{0^2+1^1+...+n^2}{(n+1)\cdot n^2} - \frac{0^2+1^1+...+m^2}{(m+1)\cdot m^2}$. Now we use a formula for the sum of squares and obtain: $\frac{n\cdot (n+1) \cdot (2n+1)}{6\cdot (n+1) \cdot n^2} - \frac{m\cdot (m+1) \cdot (2m+1)}{6\cdot (m+1) \cdot m^2} = \frac{m - n}{6mn} = \frac{n}{12n^2} = \frac{1}{12n} = \frac{1}{60}$. From the last equality, we get that $n = 5$, which is the answer.
