We have $6 = 2\cdot 3$. It has $4$ positive divisors. This means that 
  $$(|b|,|c|)\in\{ (1,6),(2,3),(3,2),(6,1) \}.$$
  Hence 
  $$-b+c \in \{-5,-1,1,5\}.$$ Indeed, if we take $b=-k$ and $c=-l$ to be negative, we get $-b+c = -l+k$, hence we get the same value as for positive $k,l$.
  
  The number $8=2^3$ also has $4$ positive divisors. This means that
  $$(|d|,|e|)\in\{ (1,8),(2,4),(4,2),(8,1) \}.$$
  Hence analogously 
  $$d-e\in \{-7,-2,2,7\}.$$
  Therefore
  $$b-c+d-e \in \{\pm 12,\pm 8,\pm 7,\pm 6,\pm 3,\pm 2,\pm 1\}$$
  and hence $a$ is the sum of $13$ and one of those numbers. As the numbers $+n$ and $-n$ cancel, we get in total
  $$14\cdot 13 = 182.$$
