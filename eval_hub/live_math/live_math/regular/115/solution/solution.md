By adding all the equations together and bringing everything to the left-hand side, we get
$$ (x^2-1)^2 + (y^2-1)^2 + (z^2-1)^2 + (t^2-1)^2 = 0.$$
This means that all the summands are 0, hence each of $x$, $y$, $z$, $t$ is equal to either $1$ or to $-1$. Hence we can plug in 1 to every monomial in the system with an even exponent. This then gives $y = t$ and $z=x$. Hence we get $4$ possible quadruples:
$$(1,1,1,1), \quad (1,-1,1,-1), \quad (-1,1,-1,1) \quad (-1,-1,-1,-1).$$
One checks easily that they all satisfy the system.
