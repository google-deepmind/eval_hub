Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$ be the numbers of participants of corresponding nationalities. As every Azerbaijani participant knows exactly $653$ other participants, and every participant knows exactly $100$ Azerbaijani participants, we have
 $$653 a = 100 n.$$
 Analogously
 $$653 b = 102 n$$
 $$653 c = 117 n$$
 $$653 d = 134 n$$
 $$653 e = 200 n.$$
 We get from the conditions that $n$ must be divisible by $653$. Moreover, as every participant knows exactly $653$ among the others, the total number of participants must be even (as the sum of degrees in a graph is even). Therefore it must be divisible by $2\cdot 653=1306$. The only such number satisfying the conditions is $5224$.
