The first equation is equivalent to 
 $$(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = 1000.$$
 As $a=2b$, we know that $a-1$ and $b-1$ are divisors of $1000$ satisfying the conditions $2(b-1)+1 = a-1$. The number $1000$ has 16 divisors:
 $$1,2,4,5,8,10,20,25,40,50,100,125,200,250,500,1000 $$
 The only pair that satisfies the desired conditions is $(2,5)$. Hence we have $b-1=2$, $a-1=5$, and hence $c-1=100$. There is only one triple satisfying the conditions.
