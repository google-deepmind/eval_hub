The game board is a $11 \times 11$ square, consisting of one hundred twenty one square cells arranged in 11 columns and 11 rows, filled with numbers from 1 to 121 in an order chosen by the master of the game. In this game, the player is selecting a random row or column from this board. If the product of the numbers in the selected row or column is even, the player scores a point. However, the game master can arrange the numbers on the board, to minimize the player's chances of scoring a point. The smallest possible probability that the game master can ensure by placing the numbers properly on the board is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are coprime. Find $m+n$.
