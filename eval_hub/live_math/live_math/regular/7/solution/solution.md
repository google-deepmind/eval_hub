There are 60 even numbers between 1 and 121, and the presence of at least one even number in a row/column makes the whole product even. With fixed numbers of the board, rearranging the rows and columns does not change the parity of the product of the numbers in any row or column. So without loss of generality we can assume that all of the even numbers are in the left-right corner of the board, bounded by a rectangle $a\times b$, such that $60 \leqslant ab$. Thus $b \leqslant \frac{60}{a}$c, and then $a+b \leqslant a+\frac{60}{a} = \frac{a^2 + 60}{a}$. We would like to find the minimum of $f(a) := \frac{a^2 + 60}{a}$. We have $f'(a) = \frac{2a^2 - a^2 - 60}{a^2}= \frac{a^2 - 60}{a^2}$, and the minimum is clearly attained in $a = \sqrt{60} \approx 7.7$. Let's take $a = 8$. We want $60 \leqslant 8b$, so $b \geqslant 7.5$. The smallest integer $b$ possible will be thus 8. So the smallest possible number of rows and columns in total equals 16. The probabililty that we are looking for equals $\frac{16}{22} = \frac{8}{11}$, and thus the answer is $8+11 = 19$.\\
