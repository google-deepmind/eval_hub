We can split the intersection into two halves by a line perpendicular to the line connecting the two centers of the circles. The boundaries of the areas are arc and chord. The area of the circular segment can be calculated as a part of the sector that remains after removing the triangle formed by the center of the circle and the two endpoints of the circular arc on the boundary. The length of the half of the chord is obtained from a right angle triangle with the hypotenuse of $R$ and legs $R/4$ and a half of the chord.
