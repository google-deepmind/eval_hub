We need to find one set of 10 numbers, where we get the least numbers of duplicates after summing every pair and second set of 10 numbers where we get the biggest number of duplicates. We can get at most $10 \choose 2$ $=45$ different numbers and this can be achieved for example when we take $\{2^i|1\leq i \leq 10\}$. The least number of duplicates we can achieve for example when we take 10 numbers from 1 to 10. From this we obtain 17 different results of sums of pairs. The minimum number of different sums is $17$ just considering $a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n$ and noticing that $a_1+a_2 < a_1+a_3 < \cdots < a_1+a_{10} < a_2 + a_{10} < a_3+a_{10} < \cdots < a_9+a_{10}$ so at least we have $17$ different values (an example would be $a_k=k$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,10$). So the biggest value of $a$ they can achieve is 45 and the smallest value of $b$ they can achieve is 17. $a-b = 28$.
