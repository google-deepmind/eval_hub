Two points are at distance 1 if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. When forming a unit square, all 4 points have the same coordinates except for 2 dimensions. There are $10 \choose 2$ options on how we can choose these dimensions. If we have fixed them, there are exactly 4 unit squares in the chosen plane. In the end, there are $3^8$ options for the choice of coordinates in the remaining 8 dimensions. The answer is $3^8 \cdot 4 \cdot $$10\choose 2$ $=1180980$.
