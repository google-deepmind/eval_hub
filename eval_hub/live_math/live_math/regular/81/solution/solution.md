The answer is $44$ since the only tiles which will remain ON are which are labelled with perfect squares. Since $2025=45^2$, it is clear that from $1$ to $2024$ are exactly $44$ perfect squares. This is because any positive integer can be decomposed uniquely by prime factors as $n=p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}$ and the number of its divisors $d(n)$ is given by $d(n)=(\alpha_1+1) \cdots (\alpha_k +1)$. It is clear that tile $n$ will be pressed exactly $d(n)$ times. Hence, if $d(n)$ is even, then the tile will remain OFF. If $d(n)$ is odd, then the tile will become ON. The only possibility for $d(n)$ to be odd is that all the exponents $\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_k$ are even and this is true if and only if $n$ is a perfect square and we are done.
