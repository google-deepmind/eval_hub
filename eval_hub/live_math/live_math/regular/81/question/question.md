A path consists of 2024 tiles arranged in a row. The tiles have two states: ON and OFF. Every time someone clicks on one of these tiles, it changes its state. At first, all the tiles are OFF. Person $1$ walks the entire path stepping on all the tiles. After that, Person $2$ goes the entire way jumping $2$ at a time, that is, he presses tile $2$, tile $4$, etc. Person $3$ jumps $3$ at a time. This pattern continues, with Person $k$ stepping on every $k$-th tile (tiles $k, 2k, 3k, \ldots$) and flipping their states (once they reach the last tile or get off the path, they stop). When the 2024 people have passed along the path, how many tiles will remain lit?
