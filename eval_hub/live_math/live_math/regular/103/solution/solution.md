First of all, notice that the circumcircle of $ABC$ is homothetic to the circumcircle of $DEF$, with the centre in the orthocentre of $ABC$ and scale $2$. Let $\alpha = \angle EDF$. By cosine theorem we have
 $$EF^2 = DF^2 + DE^2 - 2 DE \cdot DF \cdot \cos \alpha. $$
This gives
$$\cos\alpha = \frac{2\cdot 45^2+17^2-53^2}{2\cdot 17\cdot 45\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1530}{1530\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$$
Hence $\alpha = 45^\circ$. Therefore if $X$ is the centre of the circumcircle of $DEF$, we have $\angle EXF = 90^\circ$. As $EF = 53$ and $FX=XE$, this means that $FX = XE = \frac{53}{\sqrt{2}}$. This is then the circumradius of $DEF$, and the circumradius of $ABC$ is $53\sqrt{2}$. Hence its area is $5618 \pi$.
