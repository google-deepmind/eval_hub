The only possibility is that the three triangles meet in one point on the boundary of the quadrilateral. Then two of the angles of the quadrilateral are also angles of the triangles. The other two are sums of two angles of the triangles. Easy check shows that the angles with measures $60^\circ$ and $70^\circ$ are the angles of the triangles. Hence the smallest angle is $50^\circ$.
