# The LiveMath benchmark

Welcome to LiveMath, an evolving benchmark designed to continuously challenge
and evaluate the frontiers of mathematical reasoning in advanced AI systems. The
problems contained herein were created to test the limits of reasoning in Large
Language Models. Some of the problems are completely new, while others were
previously utilized in the evaluation of Google's Gemini series of models
(versions 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 Pro), where they appeared as HiddenMath in the
Gemini tech-reports.

The primary objective of this collection is to assess capabilities beyond rote
computation and pattern-matching, requiring instead a deeper and more flexible
mode of mathematical thought. **Crucially, this is a "living" benchmark.** As
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models improve, we are committed to regularly updating
this collection with new, more challenging problems to ensure it remains a
discriminative tool for the research community.

#### **Problem Categories**

The problems are organized into three distinct categories to facilitate a
structured evaluation:

*   **Regular Problems:** This section comprises a baseline of challenges across
    core high school disciplines, intended to gauge fundamental problem-solving
    proficiency and provide a stable evaluation for smaller models.
*   **Difficult Problems:** This section presents more complex problems, with
    difficulty roughly comparable to the AIME competition, designed to
    stress-test even the most capable models.
*   **Multimodal Problems:** A critical and forward-looking component, these
    problems integrate visual information—such as diagrams, graphs, and
    geometric figures—directly into the problem statements. This necessitates a
    sophisticated fusion of visual perception and symbolic reasoning. This set
    contains not only high school problems but also recreational and
    college-level mathematics and remains a significant challenge for all
    models.

#### **How We Envision This Benchmark Being Used**

As of mid-2025, SOTA models can solve a vast majority of the text-only problems
in this benchmark. However, its value extends far beyond achieving a high score.
We encourage the community to use LiveMath for:

1.  **Diagnosing Model Weaknesses:** Use the full problem set for **qualitative
    error analysis**. Investigate *why* models fail—are the errors logical,
    computational, or interpretative? Understanding these remaining failure
    modes is critical for progress.
2.  **Pushing the Frontier of Multimodal Reasoning:** The `Multimodal Problems`
    section remains a significant open challenge. We believe this is a key area
    for future research and innovation, and we will continue to expand this
    section.
3.  **Evaluating Specialized and Efficient Models:** The `Regular` and
    `Difficult` text-based problems serve as a robust yardstick for evaluating
    smaller, specialized, or more resource-efficient models, for which these
    problems are still very challenging.
4.  **Tracking Longitudinal Progress:** By using our versioned releases,
    researchers can reliably track the progress of their models over time
    against a difficult and evolving standard.
5.  **A Continuously Renewed Challenge:** Our "live" approach saves researchers
    the effort of sourcing new, difficult problems. You can rely on us to keep
    the benchmark ahead of the curve, allowing you to focus on building better
    models.

#### **Problem Curation and Expert Collaboration**

The problems in this benchmark are the product of a dedicated collaboration with
a team of six professional mathematicians. Their collective expertise, spanning
academic research and competitive mathematics, was instrumental in creating this
problem set.

To ensure the highest quality and novelty, these problems were **commissioned
through a formal consulting engagement**. The experts were compensated for their
time, creativity, and deep subject matter expertise. This model of engagement,
rather than crowdsourcing, was chosen to guarantee that the problems are not
only challenging but also mathematically sound, nuanced, and truly
representative of the complex reasoning we aim to test.

#### **Known Issues and Future Plans**

Over the period from early 2024 until mid-2025, top-tier models evolved from
solving ~10% of text problems to nearly all of them, and from ~0% of multimodal
problems to roughly 50%.

We estimate that the current release may have up to 10% of noisy samples, with
noise including typos, errors in images, missing solution components, ambiguous
formulations, or conceptual errors. We are actively working to fix these issues
and will release cleaned versions in the future.

a prompt.
